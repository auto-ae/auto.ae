# Showrooms: Finance and Insurance Services

## Overview
One of the biggest advantages of buying from a showroom is the "One-Stop Shop" service. Instead of running to the bank yourself, many dealers have in-house finance officers who can approve your loan in 24 hours.

| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Down Payment** | By Central Bank law, you must pay 20% of the car value upfront. The bank only finances 80%. |
| **Salary Transfer** | Some banks require you to move your salary to them to get a lower interest rate. |

## Dealer Finance Process

### 1. Document Submission
You give the dealer:
*   Passport/Visa/E-ID copies.
*   3-6 months Bank Statements.
*   Salary Certificate.

### 2. Evaluation
The dealer sends your papers to 3-4 partner banks (ENBD, ADHD, DIB, etc.) to see who offers the best rate.

### 3. LPO (Local Purchase Order)
The bank approves the loan and issues an LPO to the dealer, promising to pay. The dealer then registers the car in your name.

## Important tips
*   **The "Zero Down Payment" Trick:** Legally, 20% is required. Some dealers inflate the car price on the invoice so the bank financing covers the real price. This is risky and gray-market. Be careful.
*   **Insurance:** Dealers often bundle insurance. It's convenient but usually 10-20% more expensive than buying it yourself online. Compare prices.

## Common mistakes
*   **Signing Blank Checks:** Never sign a blank security check. The amount should be filled in.
*   **Assuming Approval:** Don't pay a non-refundable deposit until the Bank Approval is 100% confirmed.
