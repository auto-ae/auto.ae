# Showrooms: Contacting Showrooms

## Overview
Dealers are busy. They handle dozens of leads a day. To get the best response (and the best price), you need to communicate like a serious buyer, not a window shopper. This guide gives you the etiquette to get VIP treatment.

## Key concepts explained
| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Walk-In** | Visiting the showroom without an appointment. Acceptable in UAE, but you might wait if sales agents are busy. |
| **Cash Buyer** | Someone paying the full amount immediately (Bank transfer or Cash), not waiting for bank finance approval. |

## Communication Channels

### 1. WhatsApp (The Gold Standard)
*   **Why:** Dealers love it. They can send you location pins, extra photos, and PDF specs.
*   **Best First Message:** "Hi, I am interested in the [White Toyota Prado 2023]. Is it GCC specs? When can I see it?"

### 2. Phone Call
*   **Why:** Use this for urgent questions ("Are you open right now?").
*   **Don't:** Don't try to negotiate the final price over a 1-minute phone call. They won't take you seriously.

### 3. In-Person Visit
*   **Why:** The only way to close a deal.
*   **Tip:** Go on weekday mornings (Monday-Thursday) for the best attention. Weekends are chaotic.

## Important tips
*   **Ask for the "Best Cash Price":** Even if you are financing, asking this reveals the absolute floor price.
*   **Confirm Availability:** Cars sell fast. Always message "Is it still available?" before driving 45 minutes to the showroom.

## Common mistakes
*   **Ghosting:** If you change your mind, just say "Thanks, I found another car." Don't just block the dealer. They share blacklists of "time wasters" sometimes.
*   **Messaging at 2 AM:** Showrooms are businesses, not 24/7 bots. Respect working hours (9 AM - 9 PM usually).
