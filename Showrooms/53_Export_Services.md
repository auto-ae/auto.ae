## What this page covers

*   Shipping Methods (Land vs Sea vs Air).
*   VAT Refunds on Exports (The "Zero-Rating" rule).

## Key concepts explained
| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **VCC (Vehicle Clearance Certificate)** | The "birth certificate" of a car imported to UAE. Essential if you are re-exporting a brand new car. |
| **Blue Plates** | Temporary export plates issued by RTA. Valid for 14 days, allowing you to drive the car to the border or port. |

## The Export Process

### 1. Purchase & Deregistration
*   You buy the car.
*   The dealer takes the car to RTA and issues an "Export Certificate" in your name.
*   The old UAE plates are removed.

### 2. Shipping
*   **Land:** Used for GCC neighbors (Saudi, Oman). The car is loaded on a recovery truck.
*   **Sea (Container):** Closest port is Jebel Ali. Used for Africa/Europe. Takes 20-40 days.
*   **Air:** Expensive but fast. Used for Supercars.

### 3. Customs at Destination
*   You are responsible for paying the import tax in your country (e.g., KSA VAT 15% + Customs 5%).

## Important tips
*   **VAT Refund:** If you export a car within 90 days, you *might* be eligible to claim back the 5% UAE VAT. This is complex and requires a "Zero-Rated" tax invoice from the dealer. Ask about this *before* you pay.
*   **Insurance:** Your UAE insurance stops the moment the car gets Blue Plates. You need special "Export Insurance" for the journey.
