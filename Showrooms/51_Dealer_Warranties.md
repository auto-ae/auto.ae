# Showrooms: Dealer Warranties

## Overview
A warranty is your safety net. If the engine explodes 10 minutes after you buy the car, who pays? Dealing with warranties in the used car market can be confusing. This page explains the different types of warranties you will find on **AUTO.AE**.

*   Agency (Manufacturer) Warranty.
*   Dealer (In-House) Warranty.
*   Third-Party Warranty.

## Key concepts explained
| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Powertrain Only** | A warranty that *only* covers the Engine and Gearbox. It does not cover AC, windows, or electronics. |
| **Bumper-to-Bumper** | Covers almost everything (except tires and brake pads). This is usually only found on very new cars. |

## Types of Warranties

### 1. Agency Warranty (Gold Standard)
*   **What is it:** The original manufacturer warranty (e.g., Al Futtaim Toyota).
*   **Best for:** Peace of mind. Valid at any official service center.
*   **Value:** Adds 10-15% to the car's price.

### 2. Dealer Warranty (In-House)
*   **What is it:** The showroom promises to fix the car *at their own garage*.
*   **Risk:** Often strictly "Engine & Gear" only. If the AC fails, they won't fix it.
*   **Restriction:** You usually cannot take the car to another garage.

### 3. Third-Party Warranty
*   **What is it:** An insurance policy bought separately. Companies like "AAA" or "Gulf Warranty" provide it.
*   **Access:** You can visit a network of approved garages.

## Important tips
*   **Read the Fine Print:** Most used car warranties require you to service the car every 5,000 km. If you miss a service by 100km, they might void the warranty.
*   **Ask for the Booklet:** "Under Warranty" means nothing without the physical booklet or digital contract proving it.
