## Key concepts explained
| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Trade License** | A legal document issued by the DED (Department of Economic Development) allowing a company to trade cars. |
| **Verified Badge** | A blue tick checkmark on the AUTO.AE profile, indicating we have seen their Trade License and office location. |

## Verification Process
To become a "Verified Showroom" on AUTO.AE, a dealer must submit:
1.  **DED Trade License:** Proving they are a legal entity.
2.  **Office Location:** We verify they have a physical showroom, not just a mobile phone.
3.  **Clean Record:** History of resolving customer complaints.

## Important tips
*   **Legal Protections:** When you buy from a licensed showroom, you are protected by UAE Consumer Rights laws. If they sell you a car with a rolled-back odometer, you can sue them. You cannot easily sue a private person.
*   **Physical Presence:** You always know where to find them if problems arise later.
