### 1. The Header
Shows the branding, location map, and working hours.
*   *Green Dot:* Indicates they are currently "Open".

### 2. The Search Bar

*   Use it to see if they have other colors of the same model: "Camry".

### 3. The Reviews Tab
*   Real feedback from buyers.
*   Check for red flags: "Hidden fees", "Delayed handover".
