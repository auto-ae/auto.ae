# Showrooms: Trade-In Process

## Overview
Trading in ("Swapping") your old car is the fastest way to buy a new one. You drive in with the old clunker and drive out with a shiny upgrade. However, convenience comes at a cost. This guide helps you navigate the **Trade-In** process on **AUTO.AE**.

## What this page covers
*   Understanding "Trade-In Value" vs "Market Value".
*   Settling existing bank loans.
*   The handover process.

## Key concepts explained
| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Wholesale Price** | The price a dealer pays for a car. This is usually 15-20% *lower* than the market retail price because they need to make a profit when reselling it. |
| **Equity** | The value of your car minus any outstanding bank loan. If your car is worth 50k and you owe the bank 30k, you have 20k "Equity" to use as a down payment. |

## How it Works

### 1. Appraisal
Drive your car to the showroom. Their team will inspect it (Paint, Engine, Test Drive). They will offer you a price on the spot.

### 2. Negotiation
They might offer 40,000 AED. You saw similar cars on AUTO.AE for 50,000 AED.
*   *Reality:* They have to recondition, advertise, and warranty it. The 10k gap is their margin.

### 3. The Swap
*   **If you have Equity:** The 40k trade-in value is deducted from the new car price.
*   **If you have a Loan:** The dealer pays off your old bank loan directly and subtracts that amount from the deal.

## Important tips
*   **Clean Your Car:** A dirty car looks like a neglected car. Spend 50 AED on a wash before the appraisal to get a better offer.
*   **bring Service Records:** Proving you maintained the car can increase the offer by thousands.

## Common mistakes
*   **Expecting Retail Price:** Never expect a dealer to pay what a private buyer would pay. You are paying for the *speed* and *convenience* of not having to sell it yourself.
