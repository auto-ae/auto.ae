# Catalog: Electric / Hybrid Basics

## Overview
Not all "Electrified" cars are the same. Some you plug in, some you just fill with petrol. This guide clears up the confusion between MHEV, HEV, PHEV, and BEV so you buy the right technology for your lifestyle.

| **Range Anxiety** | The fear of running out of battery before reaching a charger. |
| **Regen** | Recovering energy when braking. |

## The Spectrum of Electrification

### 1. Mild Hybrid (MHEV)
*   **Plug:** No.
*   **Drive:** Engine is always on. A small battery just helps the Stop/Start system.
*   **Benefit:** Saves ~5% fuel.

### 2. Full Hybrid (HEV)
*   **Plug:** No.
*   **Drive:** Can drive on electric-only for short distances (parkings / traffic jams). Engine charges the battery.
*   **Benefit:** Saves ~40% fuel. (e.g., Toyota Camry Hybrid).

### 3. Plug-in Hybrid (PHEV)
*   **Plug:** Yes.
*   **Drive:** Has a real range (e.g., 50km) on pure electric. Then the petrol engine turns on.
*   **Benefit:** Drive to work on electric, drive to Muscat on petrol. Best of both worlds.

### 4. Battery Electric (BEV)
*   **Plug:** Yes.
*   **Drive:** No engine. 100% Electric.
*   **Benefit:** Zero emissions. Instant torque. Minimal maintenance.

*Figure 1: In UAE, the standard is CCS2 (European). Avoid importing US cars with Tesla(NACS) or Type 1 ports.*

## Important tips
*   **Home Charging:** Do not buy a BEV if you live in an apartment without a dedicated charger. Relying on public malls is stressful.
*   **Resale:** Hybrids hold value well. Early BEVs with degraded batteries drop in value like rocks.
