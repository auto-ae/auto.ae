| **Crossover (CUV)** | Looks like an SUV but sits on a car chassis (unibody). Good for fuel, bad for off-road. Example: Toyota RAV4. |
| **SUV (Body-on-Frame)** | A truck chassis. Heavy, thirsty, but indestructible off-road. Example: Nissan Patrol. |

## Body Type Guide

*   **Pros:** Smoothest ride, best fuel economy, separate trunk (keeps smells out of the cabin).
*   **Cons:** Low ground clearance.
*   **Popular:** Camry, Civic, S-Class.

### 2. SUV (The UAE Favorite)
*   **Pros:** High driving position (Safety), off-road capability, 7 seats.
*   **Cons:** Harder to park, higher fuel consumption.
*   **Popular:** Land Cruiser, Patrol, Tahoe.

### 3. Coupe (The Sporty Choice)
*   **Pros:** Style, performance.
*   **Cons:** 2 doors make rear access hard. Insurance is higher.
