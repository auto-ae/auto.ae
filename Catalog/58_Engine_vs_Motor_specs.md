# Catalog: Engine vs Motor specs

## Overview
The world is going electric, and the language of speed is changing. You used to compare "Litres", now you compare "Kilowatts". This guide translates old-school petrol specs into modern electric lingo.

## What this page covers
*   kW vs HP.
*   Torque delivery (ICE vs EV).
*   Battery capacity (kWh).

## Key concepts explained
| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **ICE** | Internal Combustion Engine (Petrol/Gasoline). |
| **EV** | Electric Vehicle. |
| **Instant Torque** | Electric motors give 100% of their power the moment you touch the pedal. Petrol engines need to "rev up" to 3000-5000 RPM to get power. |

## Translation Guide

### 1. Power (HP vs kW)
*   **Petrol:** Measured in Horsepower (HP).
*   **Electric:** Measured in Kilowatts (kW).
*   **Formula:** 1 kW = 1.34 HP.
    *   *Example:* A Tesla model 3 with 200 kW = ~270 HP.

### 2. Fuel Tank (Litres vs kWh)
*   **Petrol:** Tank size (e.g., 60 Litres).
*   **Electric:** Battery Size (e.g., 80 kWh).
*   **Range:** A 60L tank might give 600km. An 80 kWh battery might give 450km.

## Visual example

*Figure 1: EV power is flat and instant. ICE power builds up slowly.*

## Important tips
*   **Regenerative Braking:** In an EV, lifting your foot off the accelerator slows the car down and charges the battery. This saves brake pads and fuel.
*   **Highway Efficiency:** Petrol cars are efficient on highways. EVs are LESS efficient at high speeds (120km/h+) because of air resistance and lack of gears.
