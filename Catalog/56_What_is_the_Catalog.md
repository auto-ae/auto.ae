# Catalog: What is the Catalog?

## Overview
While the "Buy" section shows specific cars for sale *right now*, the **Catalog** is an encyclopedia of every car model ever sold in the UAE. It is your research library. Use it to check specs, view official brochures, and read reviews before you start shopping.

## Catalog vs Listings

### 1. The Catalog (Encyclopedia)
*   **Purpose:** Research.
*   **Content:** Official photos, brochures, engine data, 0-100 times.
*   **Availability:** Shows ALL cars, even ones not currently for sale.

### 2. The Marketplace (Listings)
*   **Purpose:** Transaction.
*   **Content:** Photos of a specific used car, seller's phone number, live price.
*   **Link:** Every catalog page has a button: *"See 45 used examples for sale"*.

## Important tips
*   **Verify Features:** Sellers often lie in listings ("Full Option!"). Use the Catalog to check what "Full Option" *actually* included for that year (e.g., did the 2018 model specifically have Apple CarPlay?).
*   **Color Codes:** The catalog lists the official paint names (e.g., "Midnight Purple" vs just "Purple").
