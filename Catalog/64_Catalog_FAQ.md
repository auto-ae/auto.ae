## Specs Issues

### Q: Why does the catalog say "200 HP" but the seller says "250 HP"?
**A:** Sellers often exaggerate. The Catalog uses the official Manufacturer data for the *stock* car. Alternatively, the seller might have modified the car (Tune/Chip).

### Q: My car is a "Special Edition" but I don't see it here.
**A:** Manufacturers release hundreds of limited runs (e.g., "White Edition", "Jubilee Edition"). We group these under the closest main trim level (usually "Full Option") to keep the data clean.

## Model Year Confusion

### Q: My registration card says "2020" but the Catalog says this shape started in "2021".
**A:** In the UAE, cars sold late in the year (e.g., Dec 2020) are often registered as 2020 models even if they are technically the 2021 facelift shape. Always look at the photo, not just the year.

## Corrections

### Q: I found a mistake in the spec sheet. How can I fix it?
**A:** We love accuracy! Please click the "Report Error" button at the bottom of the specs page. If you provide a photo of the manual proving us wrong, we will update the database within 48 hours.
