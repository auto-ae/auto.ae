# Catalog: Understanding Car Specs

## Overview
Buying a car involves deciphering a lot of technical jargon. "2.0L Turbo", "AWD", "CVT" – what does it all mean for your driving experience? This guide breaks down the most common specifications found in the **AUTO.AE** Catalog.

## What this page covers
*   Engine sizes (Litres & Cylinders).
*   Transmission types.
*   Drivetrain differences (FWD vs RWD vs AWD).

## Key concepts explained
| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **HP (Horsepower)** | How *fast* the car can hit top speed. Higher HP = Higher top speed & better overtaking. |
| **Torque (Nm)** | How *strong* the car is. High torque makes the car feel punchy from a traffic light and helps in towing/off-road. |

## The Specs Sheet

### 1. Engine
*   **Displacement:** 2.0L means the engine size is 2 Litres. 5.7L is huge.
*   **Cylinders:**
    *   **4-Cylinder:** Fuel efficient, standard for sedans (Camry, Corolla).
    *   **V6 / V8:** Powerful, smoother, but thirsty for petrol (Patrol, Land Cruiser).
*   **Turbo:** A small fan that forces air into the engine to make it stronger. A 2.0L Turbo can be as fast as a 3.5L non-turbo.

### 2. Drivetrain
*   **FWD (Front Wheel Drive):** Most common. Safe, efficient.
*   **RWD (Rear Wheel Drive):** Sporty feeling (BMW, Mustang). Harder to control in rain/sand.
*   **AWD / 4WD:** Power to all 4 wheels. Essential for desert driving.

## Important tips
*   **Don't Obsess over HP:** A 300 HP large SUV will feel slower than a 200 HP small hatchback. Check the "Power-to-Weight" ratio.
*   **Fuel Economy:** In the UAE, fuel is relatively cheap, but a V8 will still cost you 400+ AED to fill up.
