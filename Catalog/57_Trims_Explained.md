## Important tips
*   **The "Sunroof" Rule:** In the UAE market, a car with a sunroof is significantly easier to resell than one without, even if you never use it.
*   **Don't Overpay for "Full Option" if it's old:** Electronic gadgets (Navigation, Screens) age badly. A 10-year-old "Full Option" car might have a broken screen that costs thousands to fix.
