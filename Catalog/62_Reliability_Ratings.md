# Catalog: Reliability Ratings

## Overview
A beautiful car that spends 6 months in the workshop is a bad car. In the UAE's harsh climate (50°C heat + sand), reliability is the #1 factor for most buyers. **AUTO.AE** aggregates global data and local mechanic feedback to give every model a Reliability Score.

## Key concepts explained
| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Bulletproof** | A slang term for engines that can hit 500,000 km with zero issues (e.g., Lexus LS430, Toyota Land Cruiser). |
| **Money Pit** | A car that is cheap to buy but ruins you with repair bills (e.g., Used Range Rover or BMW 7-Series out of warranty). |

## The "Toyota Tax"
You will notice that a used Toyota Camry costs 2x more than a used Chevrolet Malibu of the same year. This difference is called the "Toyota Tax". You are paying upfront for the guarantee that you won't pay for repairs later.
*   *Verdict:* It is usually worth it if you plan to keep the car for 3+ years.

## Important tips
*   **The "AC Test":** Never buy a car in winter without testing the AC on "Max Cold". If it takes more than 2 minutes to get freezing cold, walk away.
*   **German Cars:** They are reliable *if maintained perfectly*. If the previous owner skipped oil changes, do not buy it. Japanese cars are more forgiving of neglect.
