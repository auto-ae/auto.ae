## Key concepts explained
| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Direct Competitor** | Cars in the same segment (e.g., Camry vs Accord). Meaningful comparison. |
| **Cross-Shopping** | Comparing different segments (e.g., Used Lexus LS460 vs New Toyota Yaris). Comparing luxury used vs economy new is a common buyer dilemma. |

## How to Compare

### 1. Select the First Car
Go to the Catalog page for the Toyota Camry 2024. Click the **"Vs"** icon (Add to Compare).

### 2. Add Competitors
Search for "Honda Accord". Add it. You can compare up to 4 cars at once.

### 3. Analyze the Data
The table will show rows for Engine, Transmission, Fuel Economy, and Dimensions.
*   **Winner Highlighting:** The system automatically bolds the better spec (e.g., the car with higher HP or better MPG).

## Important tips
*   **Compare Dimensions:** Check the "Length" and "Width". If you have a small parking in your villa, a Nissan Patrol might literally not fit. This tool saves you the embarrassment of buying a car that is too big.
*   **Fuel Economy vs Tank Size:** Don't just look at MPG. Look at "Range per Tank". A big tank is useful for long Abu Dhabi commutes.
