# Catalog: Depreciation Calculator

## Overview
A car is (usually) a liability, not an asset. Its value drops the moment you drive it off the lot. The **AUTO.AE Depreciation Calculator** uses historical data from thousands of sales to predict how much your car will be worth in 1, 3, or 5 years.

## What this page covers
*   The "First Year Drop".
*   Brand-specific curves (Toyota vs BMW).
*   Mileage impact.

## Key concepts explained
| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Residual Value** | The % of the original price remaining after X years. e.g., A Toyota Land Cruiser has 70% residual value after 3 years. |
| **Depreciation Curve** | The rate at which the value falls. It is steep at first, then flattens out around Year 5. |

## How it Works

### 1. The Algorithm
Our calculator looks at:
*   **Brand Reputation:** (Toyota holds, Maserati drops).
*   **Body Type:** (SUVs hold, Coupes drop).
*   **Condition:** (Accident-free vs Repaired).

### 2. Example: German Luxury vs Japanese Reliability
*   **Scenario:** You buy a BMW 7-Series for 500,000 AED.
    *   Year 1: 350,000 AED (-30%).
    *   Year 3: 200,000 AED (-60%).
*   **Scenario:** You buy a Land Cruiser for 400,000 AED.
    *   Year 1: 380,000 AED (-5%).
    *   Year 3: 320,000 AED (-20%).

## Visual example

*Figure 1: The 'Toyota Line' is almost flat, while the 'Luxury Line' dives steep.*

## Important tips
*   **Buy 3 Years Old:** The "Sweet Spot" for buying luxury cars is at 3-4 years old. The first owner paid for the massive depreciation drop. You get a great car for 40% of the price.
*   **Mileage Matters:** A 2020 car with 200,000km is worth less than a 2018 car with 50,000km.
