## Common Phishing Scripts

### 1. The "Delivery" Scam (Targeting Sellers)
*   **Message:** "I want to buy your car. I will send a courier agent to pick it up. Please pay for the insurance fee via this link: [fake-link]. I will refund you later."
*   **Reality:** There is no courier. They just want your card info.

### 2. The "Update Account" Scam
*   **Message:** "Your AUTO.AE account is suspended. Click here to verify your identity."
*   **Reality:** They want your login password.

*Figure 1: Always check the domain name. If it's not 'auto.ae', it's a scam.*

## Important tips
*   **Never Pay to Receive Money:** Why would you need to enter your CVV code to *receive* a payment? That makes no sense.
*   **Report Numbers:** Forward suspicious SMS to **8002626** (Aman Service by Dubai Police).
