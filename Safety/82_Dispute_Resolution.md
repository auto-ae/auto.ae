## What this page covers
*   "Sold as Seen" principle.
*   Hidden Defects law.
*   Mediation tips.

## Key concepts explained
| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Sold as Seen** | The general rule for private sales. Once you pay and transfer the car, it is yours. The seller has no obligation to fix future problems. |
| **Hidden Defect (Gish)** | A fault that the seller *knew about* and *actively hid* (e.g., disconnecting the Check Engine light bulb). This is illegal. |

## Common Scenarios

### 1. The "Next Day Breakdown"
*   **Case:** You drive home and the radiator leaks.
*   **Result:** Bad luck. Unless you can prove the seller patched it with gum to hide it, you have to pay for the repair. This is why Pre-Purchase Inspection is vital.

### 2. The "Odometer Rollback"
*   **Case:** Listing said 50k km. RTA report says it had 200k km last year.
*   **Result:** This is criminal fraud. You can file a Police case and demand a full refund.

## Visual example

*Figure 1: Only seek legal action if the amount exceeds 20,000 AED, otherwise lawyer fees will cost more than the repair.*

## Important tips
*   **Keep it Civil:** Screaming on the phone won't get your money back. Calmly explain the issue. Many sellers are honest and might offer to split the repair bill (even if they don't have to).
*   **Evidence:** Save the original listing screenshot where they claimed "Perfect Condition".
