| **Escrow** | A financial arrangement where a third party holds payment until the deal is done. AUTO.AE does NOT offer escrow services. We only connect buyers and sellers. |
| **Caveat Emptor** | "Buyer Beware." The legal principle that the buyer is responsible for checking the quality of goods before purchasing. |

## The 3 Pillars of Safety

### 1. Identity Verification
*   We use UAE Pass and OTP verification to ensure every user is a real person with a registered UAE mobile number.
*   *Limitation:* Scammers can still use "Burner phones", so always be vigilant.

### 2. Fraud Detection Algorithms
*   Our system scans messages for keywords like "Western Union", "Shipping Agent", or "Click this link".
*   Users are blocked automatically if they exhibit bot-like behavior.

### 3. Community Reporting
*   Users like you are the best defense. If you report a scammer, our team reviews it within 15 minutes.

## Important tips
*   **We Never Ask for Passwords:** AUTO.AE support will NEVER ask for your OTP or password. If anyone asks, they are hackers.
*   **Off-Platform Risks:** If a seller says "Let's talk on Email" instead of WhatsApp/In-App, be suspicious.
