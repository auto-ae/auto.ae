## What this page covers
*   Manager's Cheque vs Personal Cheque.
*   Bank Transfer pitfalls.
*   Cash handling risks.

## Key concepts explained
| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Manager's Cheque** | A cheque guaranteed by the bank. The money is already withdrawn from the sender's account. It cannot bounce. (Safest). |
| **Personal Cheque** | A paper promise. It can bounce if the account is empty. **Never accept these for car sales.** |

## Safe Payment Methods

### 1. Inside the RTA (Cash/Deposit)
*   Complete the transfer at the RTA counter.
*   Once the officer says "Transfer Approved", hand over the cash or do the Bank Deposit at the ATM inside the RTA center.

### 2. Instant Bank Transfer
*   Use your banking app to transfer funds.
*   **Wait** until the seller sees the SMS confirmation on *their* phone. Do not trust a screenshot of "Transfer Successful" on the buyer's phone (it can be photoshopped).

### 3. Manager's Cheque
*   Best for amounts over 50,000 AED.
*   Verify the cheque by calling the issuing bank before signing the transfer papers.

## Important tips
*   **No Western Union:** If a seller asks for Western Union or Bitcoin, it is 100% a scam.
*   **Count the Cash:** If accepting cash, use a bill counting machine (available at RTA typing centers) to detect fake notes.
