## What this page covers
*   Sending Mulkiya (Registration Card) copies.
*   Sending Emirates ID copies.
*   Digital watermarking.

## Key concepts explained
| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Mulkiya** | The gold card describing the car. It contains your name and traffic file number. It is somewhat public. |
| **Emirates ID** | Your national ID. It is highly sensitive. Scammers can use it to open bank accounts or register SIM cards in your name. |

## Watermarking Documents

### 1. Why Watermark?
If a scammer asks for your ID "just to check", they might Photoshop it to trick someone else.
*   *Solution:* Always write "FOR CAR SALE ONLY" across the image.

### 2. How to do it
*   **WhatsApp:** Before hitting send, use the "T" (Text) tool to type "FOR AUTO.AE SALE ONLY" over the image.
*   **Phone Editor:** Open the photo in your gallery, click Edit -> Markup -> Pen. Scribble over the edges.

## Visual example

## Important tips
*   **Never Send OTPs:** Your Emirates ID is useless to a hacker *unless* they also get the OTP sent to your phone. Never share that code.
*   **Mask the Number:** You can blur out the last 5 digits of your EID number. The buyer only needs to see your face and name to know you are the owner.
