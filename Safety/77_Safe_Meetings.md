## Key concepts explained
| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Public Place** | A location with CCTV cameras and other people. e.g., Petrol Station, Mall Parking, RTA Center. |
| **Sandy Lot** | Avoid meeting in empty sandy areas in industrial zones at night. |

## The Golden Rules

### 1. The Location
*   **Best:** Any "ADNOC" or "ENOC" petrol station. They have bright lights, cameras, and staff 24/7.
*   **Alternate:** The parking lot of a major supermarket (Lulu / Carrefour).

### 2. The Test Drive
*   **Never go alone:** Bring a friend.
*   **Check ID:** Before letting them drive your car, ask to see their Driving License. Take a photo of it. If they wreck your car, you need to know who they are.
*   **Stay in the car:** Never get out of the car while the engine is running and the buyer is in the driver's seat.

## Important tips
*   **Trust Your Gut:** If the buyer sounds aggressive or weird on the phone, cancel the meeting. You are not obligated to sell to them.
*   **Daylight:** Try to meet during the day. Scratches and dents are impossible to see at night.
