## The 10 Commandments

### Pre-Meeting
- [ ] **Research Price:** I know the market value of this car.
- [ ] **Check VIN:** I have Googled the VIN and checked for US salvage history.
- [ ] **Call First:** I have spoken to the seller on the phone (not just WhatsApp).

### The Meeting
- [ ] **Public Place:** We are meeting at a petrol station or RTA.
- [ ] **ID Check:** I have seen the seller's Emirates ID and it matches the name on the Mulkiya.
- [ ] **Cold Start:** I heard the engine start from stone cold.

### The Deal
- [ ] **Inspection:** I have a PPI report or I am a mechanic myself.
- [ ] **Test Drive:** I drove the car for at least 15 minutes (Highway & City).
- [ ] **No Cash in Hand:** I will only Transfer money inside the RTA after the transfer is approved.
- [ ] **Keys:** I have tested BOTH keys (remotes often die).

## Red Flags (Immediate Walk Away)
*   🚩 "The car is with my friend, just send me the money."
*   🚩 "I lost the Mulkiya but I promise it's mine."
*   🚩 "The AC just needs gas." (It never just needs gas. It needs a compressor).
*   🚩 "I'm in a rush, let's skip the inspection."
