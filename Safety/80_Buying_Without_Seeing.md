## What this page covers
*   Pre-Purchase Inspections (PPI).
*   Video calls.
*   Shipping risks.

## Key concepts explained
| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **PPI (Pre-Purchase Inspection)** | Hiring a 3rd party mechanic to visit the seller, inspect the car, and send you a PDF report with photos. |
| **Blind Buying** | Buying a car relying only on the seller's photos. **Never do this.** |

## The Risk Factors

### 1. Photo Manipulation
Photos can be edited to hide scratches. Old photos can be used.
*   *Solution:* Demand a live video call. Walk around the car *live*. Ask the seller to "Open the glovebox" or "Turn on the wipers" to prove the video is live.

### 2. The "Deposit" Trap
Seller says: "Many people want this car. Send 2000 AED to reserve it."
*   *Rule:* Never send a deposit for a car you haven't seen (or had inspected). You will likely never see that money again.

### 3. How to do it safely
1.  **Video Call:** Verify car exists.
2.  **Order PPI:** Pay a trusted garage (not the seller's friend) to inspect it.
3.  **Fly In:** It is cheaper to fly to Dubai (500 AED flight) than to lose 50,000 AED on a lemon.

## Important tips
*   **Export Plates:** If you are exporting, do not pay the full amount until the car is at the border/port and you have the Export Certificate in your hand (or your agent's hand).
