## Key concepts explained
| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Cracking the Window** | Leaving the window open 1 cm to let hot air escape. **Warning:** Don't do this if sandstorms are forecast. |
| **Thermal Shock** | Washing a super-hot car with ice-cold water. This can crack the paint or glass. |

## Survival Guide

### 1. Tires
*   Hot tarmac dissolves rubber. Check your tires for cracks every week.
*   **Danger:** Under-inflated tires flex more and generate heat, leading to blowouts. Keep them at proper pressure.

### 2. Battery
*   Heat kills batteries faster than cold. If your battery is 2 years old, replace it *before* July. You don't want to be stranded at noon.

### 3. AC Gas
*   If the AC feels weak, top up the gas. Also, change the Cabin Filter (it gets clogged with sand).

## Important tips
*   **No Lighters:** Never leave a lighter, power bank, or aerosol can in the car. They WILL explode.
*   **Park in Shade:** It sounds obvious, but walking an extra 50 meters to park under a tree saves your dashboard from melting.
