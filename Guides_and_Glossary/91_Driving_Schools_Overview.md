## Important tips
*   **VIP Package:** If you have money (20,000 AED) but no time, buy the VIP package. A luxury car picks you up from your office, and you can finish the whole license in 1 week.
*   **Unlimited Package:** If you are a bad driver, pay extra for "Unlimited Tests". Otherwise, you pay ~1000 AED every time you fail.
