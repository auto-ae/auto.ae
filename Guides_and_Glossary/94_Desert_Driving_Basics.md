# Guides & Glossary: Desert Driving Basics

## Overview
You live in a desert. Eventually, you will want to drive on the sand. But taking your Camry into the dunes is a recipe for disaster. This guide covers the basics of "Daming" (Dune Bashing).

## What this page covers
*   Deflating tires.
*   The "Flag".
*   Recovery Gear.

## Key concepts explained
| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **PSI** | Pounds per Square Inch (Tire Pressure). On the road, you use 35 PSI. On sand, you must drop to 12-15 PSI. |
| **Recovery Point** | The metal hook on your chassis where a rope can be attached. |

## The Golden Rules

### 1. Deflate or Stuck
*   If you enter soft sand with full tires, you will sink immediately. Deflating increases the surface area (the "Caterpillar Effect").

### 2. Never Go Alone
*   Always go with at least 2 cars. If one gets stuck, the other can pull it out (or drive to get help).

### 3. Momentum is King
*   Speed keeps you floating. If you stop on an uphill slope, gravity will bury you.

## Important tips
*   **The Flag:** You need a tall red flag on a pole attached to your car. This lets cars on the other side of a dune see you before they crash into you.
*   **Water:** Bring 2x more water than you think you need.
