# Guides & Glossary: Glossary A-M

## Overview
The UAE car market has its own slang. From "Expats Driven" to "GCC Specs", this glossary translates the jargon.

## A
*   **Agency Repair:** The car was fixed only at the official dealership (e.g., Al Futtaim Toyota). Adds value.
*   **Accident Free:** A car with original paint and no history of collisions.
*   **American Specs:** Cars imported from the USA. Cheaper, but harder to insure. Often have salvage history.

## C
*   **Chassis Number:** Another name for VIN (Vehicle Identification Number).
*   **Comprehensive Insurance:** Covers damage to your car AND the other car. Mandatory for bank loans.

## D
*   **Dealer:** A business that buys and sells cars.
*   **Depreciation:** The loss of value over time.

## E
*   **Export Certificate:** A paper from RTA allowing you to take the car out of the country.

## F
*   **Full Option:** The highest trim level (Leather, Sunroof, etc.).
*   **FSH (Full Service History):** Proof of all maintenance.

## G
*   **GCC Specs:** Cars built specifically for the Gulf climate (Better AC, different radiators). High resale value.
*   **Golden Bell:** A slang term for the RTA inspection "Pass" certificate.

## J
*   **JDM:** Japanese Domestic Market. Cars imported from Japan with the steering wheel on the right (illegal to register in UAE unless classic).

## K
*   **Kilometers:** UAE uses km, not miles. 1 mile = 1.6 km.

## M
*   **Mulkiya:** The vehicle registration card. Gold color. Valid for 1 year.
