*   Speeding buffer (The "+20 rule").
*   Lane discipline.
*   Discounts.

## Key concepts explained
| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Black Points** | Penalty points. If you get 24 points, your license is suspended. |
| **Impound** | The police take your car for 7-30 days. You can pay extra to keep the car at home ("Smart Impound"). |

## Common Fines

### 1. Speeding (The Grace Window)
*   **Rule:** The speed limit on the sign is 100 km/h. The camera flashes at 121 km/h. You have a 20 km/h buffer.
*   **Exception:** **Abu Dhabi has NO buffer.** If sign says 140, camera flashes at 141. Use Waze to know which emirate you are in.

### 2. Lane Discipline (400 AED)
*   Changing lanes without using your indicator (Survey says: 90% of drivers forget this).
*   "Queue Jumping" (Cutting in line at an exit).

### 3. Phone Usage (800 AED + 4 Points)
*   Holding your phone in your hand while driving. Cameras can see through your windshield.

## Important tips
*   **Knowledge Fee:** Every fine has an extra 20 AED "Knowledge Fee" added.
*   **Discounts:** Occasionally (National Day), some Emirates (Sharjah/Ajman) offer 50% discount on old fines. Dubai rarely does this.
