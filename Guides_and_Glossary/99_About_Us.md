# Guides & Glossary: About Us

## Overview
**AUTO.AE** was born in garage in 2024. We were tired of browsing clunky, ad-filled websites to buy cars. We wanted something faster, cleaner, and strictly for the UAE.

## Our Mission
To be the most trusted automotive marketplace in the Middle East.

## The Team
We are a team of 15 Petrolheads, Developers, and Designers based in Dubai Internet City.
*   **CEO:** Ahmed Al-Mansoori (Car enthusiast, ex-Rally driver).
*   **CTO:** Sarah Johnson (Tech wizard).

## Why we are different
1.  **Mobile First:** We built the App first, then the website.
2.  **Safety First:** We integrate with UAE Pass to ensure every user is verified.
3.  **Community Driven:** We listen to you. The "VIP Plates" section was added because YOU asked for it.
