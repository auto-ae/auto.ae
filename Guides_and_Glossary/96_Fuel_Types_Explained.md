## What this page covers
*   E-Plus (91).
*   Special (95).
*   Super (98).

## Key concepts explained
| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Octane Rating** | A measure of how much compression the fuel can withstand before detonating. High performance cars need high octane. |
| **Knocking** | The sound an engine makes when using low-quality fuel. It sounds like rattling coins. |

## The 3 Types

### 1. E-Plus (Red - 91 Octane)
*   **Cheapest.**
*   **Use for:** Rental cars, Taxi fleets, Old Toyotas/Nissans with big engines (V6/V8) that are low compression.
*   **Not available** at all stations.

### 2. Special (Green - 95 Octane)
*   **Standard.**
*   **Use for:** 90% of cars. Camry, Accord, Patrol, Pajero. If in doubt, use Special.

### 3. Super (Blue - 98 Octane)
*   **Premium.**
*   **Use for:** European Luxury cars (BMW, Mercedes) and Turbocharged cars.
*   **Benefit:** Better performance and cleaner engine.

## Important tips
*   **Mixing:** It is safe to mix Special and Super.
*   **Myth:** "Super gives better mileage." Not really. It just allows the engine to run at peak power. If you drive a Yaris, Super is a waste of money.
