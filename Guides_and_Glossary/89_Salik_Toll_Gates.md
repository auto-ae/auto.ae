# Guides & Glossary: Salik Toll Gates

## Overview
Dubai doesn't have toll booths where you stop and pay cash. We have **Salik** (meaning "Clear" or "Open"). It's a sticker on your windshield that automatically deducts money as you drive under the gates.

## How it Works

### 1. The Cost
*   **Tag Price:** 100 AED (Includes 50 AED credit).
*   **Passing a Gate:** 4 AED.
*   **Daily Cap:** NONE. If you pass 10 times, you pay 40 AED.

### 2. The Gates
There are 8 main gates, mostly on Sheikh Zayed Road (SZR).
*   **Al Barsha & Al Safa:** The most expensive commute.
*   **Al Maktoum Bridge:** Free at night (10 PM - 6 AM) and on Sundays.

## Important tips
*   **Buying a Used Car:** The old owner *cannot* transfer their balance to you. You must buy a NEW tag (100 AED) and remove their old one.
*   **Fine:** If you drive through a gate with insufficient balance, you have 5 days to top up. If not, the fine is 50 AED per day.
