*   **Cons:** Extremely busy. Wait times can be 2+ hours on weekends.
*   **Best for:** Buying/Selling a car (Transfer).

### 2. Shamil
*   **Pros:** Locations are often less crowded (e.g., Muhaisnah, Nad Al Hamar). Friendly service.
*   **Cons:** Limited services. Some cannot do "Export Tests" or "Golden Chassis" checks.
*   **Best for:** Yearly Renewal.

## Important tips
*   **Friday Afternoons:** Avoid them. Everyone goes after prayer. Go on Tuesday morning at 7 AM for zero queue.
*   **Mobile Testing:** Both companies offered "VIP Mobile Testing" where they come to your house for an extra fee (approx 500 AED).
