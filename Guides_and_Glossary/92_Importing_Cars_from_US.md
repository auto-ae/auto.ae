## The Math (Is it worth it?)

### Scenario: 2020 Ford Mustang
*   **US Auction Price:** 20,000 AED.
*   **Shipping:** 5,000 AED.
*   **Customs (5%):** 1,000 AED.
*   **VAT (5%):** 1,000 AED.
*   **Repair in Sharjah:** 10,000 AED.
*   **Total Cost:** 37,000 AED.
*   **Dubai Market Price:** 50,000 AED.
*   *Verdict:* You save 13k, but you are driving a crashed car.

## Important tips
*   **VIN Google Search:** ALWAYS Google the VIN of a US spec car. You will report websites showing the auction photos of the smash.
*   **Flood Damage:** Beware of cars from Florida/Texas after hurricanes. Water damage destroys electronics months later.
