# VIP Plates: Plate Formats

## Overview
Not all plates are created equal. Each Emirate has its own design language and "Code" system. Understanding these differences ensures you don't confuse a "Code 1" from Abu Dhabi with a "Series A" from Dubai.

## Emirate Designs

### 1. Dubai (RTA)
*   **Format:** One or Two Letters + Up to 5 Digits.
*   **Examples:** `A 12345` (Series A), `AA 55` (Series AA).
*   **Prestige:** Single letters (A-Z) are more valuable than double letters (AA-ZZ). "A" is the most expensive code.

### 2. Abu Dhabi (Police)
*   **Format:** Category Number + Up to 5 Digits.
*   **Examples:** `1 - 12345` (Category 1, Red Plate), `50 - 12345` (Category 50, Grey Plate).
*   **Prestige:** "Category 1" (The Red Plate) is the most iconic and valuable.

### 3. Sharjah (Police)
*   **Format:** Series Number + Up to 5 Digits.
*   **Examples:** `1  12345` (White design), `3  12345` (New Orange/White design).

## Important tips
*   **Logo Size:** In Dubai, the "Coloured Logo" is an optional upgrade. Just because a plate listing shows the colored logo doesn't mean you automatically get it. You might need to pay ~400 AED to the RTA to print it.
*   **Short Plates vs Long Plates:** Almost any number can be printed on a "Short" (European style) or "Long" (US/GCC style) physical plate. This is just a printing choice, not a registration difference.
