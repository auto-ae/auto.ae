## Key concepts explained
| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Sandwich Plate** | A number where the middle digit is different, e.g., "151", "808", "9009". These are stable investments. |
| **Super Number** | A plate where all digits are identical (e.g., "77777"). These command the highest prices. |

## The Valuation Matrix

### 1. Digits Count (The Baseline)
*   2-Digit: Start at 1M+ AED.
*   3-Digit: Start at 300k+ AED.
*   4-Digit: Start at 5k+ AED (for random) up to 500k (for perfect patterns).
*   5-Digit: Start at 0 AED (random) up to 100k (for perfect patterns).

### 2. The Zero Factor
*   Zeros are valuable *if* they are leading or trailing in a nice way.
*   **Good:** "100" (Century number), "10" (Decade).
*   **Bad:** "105" (The zero breaks the sequence 15).

### 3. The Code Premium
*   **Dubai Code A:** Adds 20-30% value compared to Code W.
*   **Abu Dhabi Code 1:** Adds 50%+ value compared to Code 15.

## Important tips
*   **Check Auction History:** Before spending big money, check recent Emirates Auction results. If "A 999" sold for 500k yesterday, don't buy "A 888" for 2 Million today.
*   **Beware of "Sentimental Value":** A seller might ask for 50k for "1993" because it's his birth year. But the *market* value is only 5k. Don't overpay for someone else's sentiment.
