## Checklist for Individuals

### 1. Buyer
*   [ ] **Emirates ID (Original):** Must be valid (not expired).
*   [ ] **Traffic File:** Must be open in the specific Emirate (e.g., Dubai). If you don't have one, open it instantly at the counter (Cost: ~200 AED).
*   [ ] **UAE Pass:** For digital signing.

### 2. Seller
*   [ ] **Emirates ID (Original).**
*   [ ] **Ownership Certificate:** The "green paper" proving he owns the plate.
*   [ ] **Unlink from Car:** If the plate is currently on a car, the seller must first pay to "retain" it (remove it from the car) before selling.
