## Buying & Selling

### Q: Can I buy a plate if I don't have a car?
**A:** Yes! You only need a Traffic File. You can hold the plate as a digital asset (Ownership Certificate) without ever printing the physical metal plate.

### Q: Why are some plates listed as "Classic"?
**A:** This refers to the physical design (Black/White). It affects the look, but not the ownership rights. You can register a "Classic" number on a modern Ferrari if you like the vintage aesthetic.

## Ownership Rules

### Q: Can I put a Dubai plate on a car registered in Abu Dhabi?
**A:** Generally, no. The car and the plate must match the Emirate. *Exception:* If you possess a residency visa in both Emirates, you *might* be able to transfer, but it's a complex manual process.

### Q: Do I own the plate forever?
**A:** Yes. Unlike in some countries where you just "rent" the number, in the UAE, the plate is your personal property. It is an asset you can leave to your children in your will.

## Legal & Taxes

### Q: Is there VAT on plates?
**A:** Yes. If you buy from a Business/Company, 5% VAT applies. If you buy from a Private Individual, there is usually no VAT on the transfer.

### Q: Can I lose my plate if I don't renew it?
**A:** If you leave a plate on a car with expired registration for years, the RTA *can* theoretically reclaim it, but this is extremely rare for VIP numbers. It is safer to "Retain" the plate (deposit it) if you are not using it.
