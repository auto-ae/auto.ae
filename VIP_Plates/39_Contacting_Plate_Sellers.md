# VIP Plates: Contacting Plate Sellers

## Overview
Trading VIP plates is a high-stakes business. Unlike selling a used car where defects are the main concern, here the concern is **Ownership Proof**. Contacting a plate seller on **AUTO.AE** requires a professional approach to verify they actually own the digits they are selling.

## Key concepts explained
| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Mulkiya** | The plastic registration card issued by the RTA. This is the ultimate proof of ownership. |
| **Broker** | A middleman selling on behalf of the owner. Brokers are common in the plate market, but always ask to speak to the owner for the final transfer. |

## Contact Etiquette

### 1. Verification First
Before making an offer:
*   "Hi, is this plate registered in your name?"
*   "Can you send a photo of the ownership certificate (hiding your personal details)?"
*   *Why:* Many people list plates they *saw* on the street hoping to broker a deal later. Avoid them.

### 2. Making an Offer
*   **Do:** "I am offering 50,000 AED, cash ready for transfer tomorrow."
*   **Don't:** "What is your last price?" (Sellers hate this).

### 3. The Meeting
*   Never transfer money based on a WhatsApp chat.
*   Agree to meet at an RTA Customer Happiness Center.

## Visual example

*Figure 1: A valid Mulkiya shows the Plate Number clearly. Verify the name matches the seller's ID.*

## Important tips
*   **"Reserved" Plates:** Sometimes a seller has a paper saying they "Reserved" the plate but haven't printed it. This is valid, but verify the reservation expiry date.
*   **Brokers Fees:** If you are dealing with a broker, clarify who pays their commission (Seller or Buyer) *before* the deal.
