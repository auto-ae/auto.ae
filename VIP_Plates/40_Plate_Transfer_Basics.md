# VIP Plates: Plate Transfer Basics

## Overview
So you’ve agreed on a price for that shiny "Dubai A 888" plate. How do you actually move it from the seller's name to yours? The process involves the RTA (Roads and Transport Authority) and has strict rules. **AUTO.AE** explains the two main methods.

*   Certificate of Ownership.
*   Fees involved.

## Key concepts explained
| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Ownership Certificate** | A document that proves you own a number plate, even if it is not currently attached to a car. |
| **Traffic File** | Your unique ID with the RTA. You need a valid Traffic File in the specific Emirate (e.g., Dubai) to receive a plate there. |

## Transfer Methods

### 1. The "Easy" Way (App Transfer)
If both Seller and Buyer have the UAE Pass / RTA App and full access:
1.  Seller logs into *Dubai Drive* app.
2.  Selects "Transfer Number Plate".
3.  Enters Buyer's Traffic File Number.
4.  Buyer accepts on their phone and pays fees.

### 2. The "Safe" Way (RTA Center)
For expensive plates, always meet in person.
1.  Go to an RTA Customer Happiness Center (e.g., Al Barsha, Deira).
2.  Take a token for "Licensing Services".
3.  Tell the officer: "I want to transfer this number to him."
4.  Officer verifies IDs.
5.  Buyer pays the transfer fee (approx. 120 AED + Innovation fees).
6.  Buyer receives the new **Ownership Certificate** paper on the spot.

## Important tips
*   **No Car Needed:** You do NOT need to own a car to buy a plate. You can just hold the Ownership Certificate in your virtual wallet.
*   **Selling Cost:** RTA charges a fee for selling plates (often a % of face value if bought from RTA directly, or a flat fee for private transfers).
