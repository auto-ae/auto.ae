# VIP Plates: Browsing Plates

## Overview
Searching for a plate is different from searching for a car. You aren't looking for "Mileage" or "Color". You are looking for a specific **Digit Combination**. The **AUTO.AE** Plate Search engine is built to help you find your birthday, your lucky number, or a pattern that matches your budget.

## Important tips
*   **Check the Transferability:** Some plates listing might say "Private Transfer Only". This means the seller wants to meet at the RTA, they don't want to sell online instantly.
*   **Logo Design:** In Dubai, you can optionally upgrade your plate to the "Coloured Logo" design. This is purely cosmetic and doesn't change the registration number value.
