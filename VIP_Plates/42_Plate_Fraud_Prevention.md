## What this page covers
*   The "Blocked Plate" scam.
*   The "Fake Ownership Paper" scam.
*   Safe Payment methods.

## Key concepts explained
| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Blocked Plate** | A plate that has unpaid fines or court orders against it. You cannot transfer it until the debts are cleared. |
| **Reserved Plate** | A plate that is "on hold" but not fully paid for at the RTA. Scammers try to sell these before they expire. |

## Common Scams

### 1. The "Sending a Driver" Trick
*   **Scenario:** Seller says "I am busy, my driver will meet you at RTA with the paper. Give him the cash."
*   **Risk:** The "driver" takes the cash, the paper is fake, and the real owner knows nothing.
*   **Solution:** Only deal with the person whose name is on the Emirates ID and Ownership Certificate.

### 2. The Photo-shop Special
*   **Scenario:** Seller sends a photo of a Mulkiya for "A 1". It looks real.
*   **Risk:** It's edited. They don't own it.
*   **Solution:** Ask to meet at RTA. Their system cannot be photoshopped.

### 3. The "Deposit to Reserve"
*   **Scenario:** "Many people want this number. Send 5000 AED now to block it for you."
*   **Risk:** They disappear.
*   **Solution:** Never transfer deposits for plates. Meet, verify, Pay.

## Important tips
*   **Use Manager's Cheques:** For amounts over 50k AED, do not carry cash. A Manager's Cheque is safe, traceable, and accepted at RTA deals.
*   **RTA Dispute:** If a deal goes wrong inside the RTA center, the security/manager can intervene immediately. This is why you meet *there*, not in a coffee shop.
