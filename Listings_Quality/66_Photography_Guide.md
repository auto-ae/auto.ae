## Key concepts explained
| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Landscape Mode** | Holding your phone sideways. Car screens are horizontal. Your photos should be horizontal. |
| **Golden Hour** | The hour after sunrise or before sunset. The light is soft and makes the car look expensive. Noon sun is harsh and ugly. |

## The Shot List (Must Haves)
Take at least these 8 photos:
1.  **Front Corner (3/4 view):** The "Hero Shot".
2.  **Back Corner (3/4 view):** Shows the rear and side.
3.  **Side Profile:** Straight on.
4.  **Dashboard:** Wide shot from the back seat.
5.  **Driver's Seat:** Show the condition of the leather/cloth.
6.  **Odometer:** Prove the mileage.
7.  **Engine Bay:** Open the hood. Show it's clean (but not wet).
8.  **Trunk:** Show it's empty.

## Important tips
*   **Remove Clutter:** Take out the tissue boxes, water bottles, and hanging prayer beads. A clean car looks newer.
*   **Background:** Don't park next to a dumpster. Drive to an empty parking lot or a nice wall.
