*   Why generic listings get ignored.
*   Completeness of data.

## Key concepts explained
| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Click-Through Rate (CTR)** | The percentage of people who see your main photo and click to read more. |
| **Conversion** | The percentage of people who read your ad and actually call/message you. |

## The Quality Score

### 1. Photos (50% of success)
A listing with 20 HD photos will sell 5x faster than a listing with 3 blurry night photos. Buyers assume "blurry photos = hiding scratches".

### 2. Description (30% of success)
"Call me for details" is a lazy description. Buyers are browsing at 2 AM; they can't call you. Write everything down (Service history, tinting, modifications).

### 3. Price (20% of success)
Price it realistically. If you are 20% above market, people will scroll past without even clicking.

## Visual example

*Figure 1: The listing on the left has a clean car, bright light, and detailed text. The one on the right is a dark vertical photo.*

## Important tips
*   **Fill every field:** Don't skip the "Options" checkboxes. Users filter by "Sunroof" or "Leather". If you didn't check the box, your car disappears from their search.
*   **Be Honest:** If there is a scratch on the bumper, photograph it close up. Buyers trust honesty. If they find it themselves later, they will walk away.
