## What this page covers
*   Difference between "Delete" and "Mark Sold".
*   Updating the final selling price (optional).
*   Reactivating a deal if it falls through.

## Key concepts explained
| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Archived** | The listing is hidden from search, but remains in your "My Listings" history. You can revive it later. |
| **Deleted** | The listing is gone forever. You cannot recover the photos or text. |

## How to Archive

### 1. Go to My Listings
*   Find the car card.
*   Click the "Options" dots (⋮).

### 2. Select "Mark as Sold"
*   The system will ask: *"Did you sell it on AUTO.AE?"*
*   **Yes:** Helping us track success rates.
*   **No:** (e.g., sold to a friend).

### 3. Enter Sold Price (Private)
*   You can optionally enter the final price. This data is **Anonymous** and helps our Valuation Algorithm become more accurate for everyone.

## Important tips
*   **Don't Delete:** If the buyer's bank loan is rejected 3 days later, you will need to put the ad back up. If you "Archived" it, you can just click "Reactivate". If you deleted it, you have to type everything again.
