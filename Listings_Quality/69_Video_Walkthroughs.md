| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Cold Start** | Creating checking the engine sound when it is completely cold (first start of the day). This proves there are no rattling noises or smoke. |
| **Walkaround** | A continuous 360-degree shot of the car's exterior. |

## How to Film a Pro Walkthrough

### 1. Preparation
*   Park in a quiet place (wind noise ruins videos).
*   Turn off the radio. We want to hear the engine, not FM radio.

### 2. The Shot List (60 Seconds)
*   **0-10s:** Exterior Walkaround. Walk slowly around the car.
*   **10-20s:** Open the door. Show the seat condition.
*   **20-30s:** Start the engine (Capture the sound).
*   **30-40s:** Rev the engine deeply (to 3000 RPM).
*   **40-50s:** Show the AC vents blowing (maybe a ribbon tied to show airflow).
*   **50-60s:** Show the odometer and any special features (Sunroof opening).

## Visual example

*Figure 1: Move smoothly. Don't shake the camera.*

## Important tips
*   **Vertical Video is OK:** Most users browse on mobile apps, so vertical (TikTok style) videos fill the screen perfectly.
*   **Narrate:** Talk to the buyer. "Here is a small scratch on the door, but the rest is perfect." This builds massive trust.
