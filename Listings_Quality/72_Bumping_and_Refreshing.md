*   Free weekly bump.
*   The "Smart Bump" algorithm.
*   Don't delete and repost.

## Key concepts explained
| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Bump** | Taking an old listing (posted 2 weeks ago) and moving it back to the top of the "Newest" sort order. |
| **Freshness Score** | The algorithm penalizes listings that haven't been touched in 30 days, assuming the car is sold or abandoned. |

## How Bumping Works

### 1. The Free Credit
Every user gets **1 Free Bump per week**.
*   Go to "My Listings".
*   Click the "Arrow Up" icon.
*   Your ad jumps to the top of the list instantly.

### 2. Don't Delete and Repost
Some sellers try to "hack" the system by deleting their ad and re-uploading it every day.
*   **AUTO.AE System:** Detection algorithms link the VIN number.
*   **Penalty:** If you repost the same VIN within 7 days, your new listing is "Shadowbanned" (visible to you, invisible to buyers). Just use the Bump button.

## Important tips
*   **Update the Price:** When you bump, try lowering the price by even 500 AED. This triggers a "Price Drop" notification to everyone who ‘Favorited’ your car.
*   **Weekend Strategy:** Save your free bump for Friday morning.
