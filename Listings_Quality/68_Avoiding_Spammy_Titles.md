## Key concepts explained
| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Keyword Stuffing** | Listing a Honda Civic but adding tags like "Corolla, Camaro, Ferrari" at the bottom to trick the search engine. This gets you banned. |
| **Caps Lock** | Typing on the internet in ALL CAPS is considered screaming. It is rude and harder to read. |

## Bad vs Good Titles

### ❌ The Spammy Way
"URGENT SALE!!! BRITISH LADY DRIVEN!! 2020 NISAN PATROL BEST PRICE IN MARKET CALL NOW 050xxxxxxx"
*   *Why it's bad:* Hard to read, desperate, contains phone number (privacy risk), misspells the brand name.

### ✅ The Professional Way
"Nissan Patrol Platinum 2020 - V8, Warranty, GCC Specs"
*   *Why it's good:* Clean, informative, lists the Engine (V8) and Spec (GCC) immediately.

## Visual example

*Figure 1: Clean titles get more clicks because they look trustworthy.*

## Important tips
*   **Don't put the Price in the Title:** "Toyota Camry 50000 AED". The system already displays the price in big bold numbers next to the title. It's redundant.
*   **Don't put "Urgent":** It makes buyers think you are desperate, so they will low-ball you with terrible offers.
