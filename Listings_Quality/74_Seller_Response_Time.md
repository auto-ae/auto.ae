## Key concepts explained
| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Ghosting** | Ignoring a buyer after they ask a question. This hurts your seller score. |
| **Lead Rot** | A potential buyer who was excited but bought another car because you took 2 days to reply. |

## Best Practices

### 1. Enable Notifications
Ensure the AUTO.AE app has permission to push notifications to your phone.
*   *Goal:* Reply to the first "Is this available?" message within 5 minutes.

### 2. Use Quick Replies
If you are busy at work, set up a generic reply:
*   *"Hi, thanks for asking. The car is available. I will call you back after 5 PM."*

### 3. Weekend Availability
Friday and Saturday are peak buying days. If you turn off your phone on weekends, you will lose 50% of your buyers.

## Important tips
*   **Whatsapp vs Call:** 80% of buyers prefer to WhatsApp first. Don't force them to call you if they don't want to.
*   **Update your Status:** If you are traveling, pause your listing so your score doesn't drop due to unanswered messages.
