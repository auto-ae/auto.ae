# Listings Quality: Writing a Description

## Overview
A picture says a thousand words, but it doesn't say "Under Warranty until Dec 2026" or "Two Keys Included". The description field is your chance to answer the buyer's questions *before* they ask.

*   Call-to-Action.

## Key concepts explained
| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Full Service History (FSH)** | A folder of receipts proving every oil change was done on time. This adds 10-15% value to the car. |
| **Lady Driven** | A common cliche in UAE listings implying the car was driven gently. Buyers are skeptical of this, so only use it if true. |

## The 5-Point Description Template
Copy-paste this into your listing:

1.  **The basics:** "selling my 2021 Toyota Fortuner VXR."
2.  **Condition:** "Pristine inside out. No smoking. Parked in basement."
3.  **Maintenance:** "Serviced only at Al Futtaim. Last service done at 60,000km."
4.  **Key Features:** "Leather seats, Navigation, Sunroof, Both keys available."
5.  **Reason for Sale:** "Leaving the country" or "Upgrading to a bigger car."

## Visual example

*Figure 1: Use bullet points. No one reads a giant wall of text.*

## Important tips
*   **Mention the Tinting:** High-quality tint (e.g., 3M or V-Kool) is expensive. Mentioning it adds value.
*   **Be Honest about Paint:** "Bumper painted for cosmetic scratches" is fine. "Original Paint" when it's clearly repainted is fraud.
