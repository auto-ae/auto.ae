## Key concepts explained
| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Market Value** | The price similar cars are *actually selling for*, not what people are asking. |
| **Low Ball** | An offer drastically lower than the asking price (e.g., offering 30k for a 50k car). |

## The Pricing Strategy

### 1. Research phase
Search **AUTO.AE** for your exact car (Year, Trim, Mileage).
*   Ignore the highest price (dreamer).
*   Ignore the lowest price (probably a scam/accident car).
*   Look at the average of the middle 5 listings. That is the Market Value.

### 2. The Psychology of Numbers
*   **The "99" Rule:** 50,000 AED feels expensive. 49,500 AED feels like a deal.
*   **Search Filters:** Buyers filter by "Max Price". If you price at 51,000, you disappear for everyone filtering "Up to 50k". Price at 49,999 to catch them.

### 3. The Buffer
Every buyer in the UAE expects a discount. It is cultural.
*   *Strategy:* If you want 45,000 in your pocket, list it for 48,000. Give the buyer the "victory" of negotiating 3,000 off.

## Important tips
*   **Modifications add 0 Value:** You spent 10,000 AED on a stereo? Sorry, the buyer doesn't care. They won't pay extra for it. In fact, some prefer stock cars.
*   **Recent Service:** If you just spent 4,000 AED on new tires and brakes, you CAN add this to the price, because it saves the buyer money immediately.
