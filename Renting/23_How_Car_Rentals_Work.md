## Key concepts explained
| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Security Deposit** | An amount blocked on your credit card to cover potential fines or damage. Refunded 15-30 days after returning the car. |
| **Mileage Limit** | The maximum km you can drive per day/month without extra charges (e.g., 250km/day). |

## The Rental Process

### 1. Verification
Before booking, ensure you have:
*   **Emirates ID** (or Passport + Visa for tourists).
*   **Driving License** (UAE license or International Permit).
*   **Credit Card** (Debit cards are rarely accepted for deposits).
*   **Age:** Most agencies require you to be 21+ (some 25+ for luxury cars).

### 2. Browse and Compare
Use AUTO.AE to find the best rate.
*   *Economy:* Nissan Sunny, Kia Pegas (~60-90 AED/day).
*   *Luxury:* Mercedes, BMW, Range Rover (~500+ AED/day).

### 3. Contact & Book
*   Message the agency via WhatsApp to confirm availability.
*   Send a copy of your documents to draft the contract.
*   Confirm the pickup time.

### 4. Pickup and Drive
*   Inspect the car for scratches **before** driving off (Take photos!).
*   Sign the digital or physical contract.

## Important tips
*   **Check the "Excess":** This is the maximum amount you pay if you crash the car. If the "Excess" is 1000 AED, you pay the first 1000 AED of any repair, insurance pays the rest.
*   **Fuel Policy:** Usually "Same-to-Same". If you pick it up with a full tank, bring it back full.

## Common mistakes
*   **Booking without a Credit Card:** 90% of legal agencies require a Credit Card for the deposit. Cash deposits are rare and risky.
*   **Returning Dirty:** You might be charged a 50-100 AED cleaning fee if the car is filthy.
