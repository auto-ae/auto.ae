# Renting: Renting for Tourists

## Overview
The UAE is one of the most car-dependent countries in the world. For tourists, renting a car is often cheaper than taxis and more convenient than the metro for reaching hidden gems. **AUTO.AE** makes it easy for visitors to get behind the wheel.

## Key concepts explained
| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **IDP** | International Driving Permit. A booklet that translates your home license. Required for many nationalities. |
| **Exempt Countries** | Countries whose citizens can drive in Dubai using their home license without an IDP (e.g., USA, UK, GCC, EU checks updated lists). |

## Tourist Checklist

### 1. License Check
*   **Group A (No IDP needed):** USA, UK, Canada, Australia, most EU countries.
*   **Group B (IDP Required):** India, China, Russia, Brazil, etc.
*   *Rule:* If your license is not in English or Arabic, you almost certainly need an IDP.

### 2. Credit Card
*   As a tourist, you **MUST** have a credit card in the main driver's name for the deposit. Debit cards or cash are usually rejected by reputable agencies.

### 3. Navigation
*   Google Maps and Waze work perfectly in UAE.
*   Download the "Offline Maps" area for Dubai before you leave your hotel Wi-Fi to save roaming data.

## Important tips
*   **Tolls (Salik):** You don't fail to pay tolls as you drive. The agency pays them and charges you at the end (usually 5 AED per gate pass).
*   **Parking:** Parking is paid almost everywhere. Use the "Dubai Drive" app or SMS parking (requires a local SIM).

## Common mistakes
*   **Thinking "I can drive because I own a property":** If you are a Resident (have a residency visa), you CANNOT use your tourist license rules. You must convert to a UAE license immediately.
*   **Speed Cameras:** They are everywhere. The limit is strict (buffer depends on Emirate). 1 km/h over in Abu Dhabi = Fine.
