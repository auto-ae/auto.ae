# Renting: Renting for Tourists

## Overview
The UAE is one of the most car-dependent countries in the world. For tourists, renting a car is often cheaper than taxis and more convenient for reaching hidden gems. **AUTO.AE** makes it easy for visitors to get behind the wheel with flexible document and payment options.

## Key concepts explained
| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **IDP** | International Driving Permit. A booklet that translates your home license. Required for many nationalities (India, China, Russia, etc.). |
| **Exempt Countries** | Countries whose citizens can drive in Dubai using their home license without an IDP (USA, UK, GCC, most EU countries). |

## Tourist Checklist

### 1. Documents Required
You must present:
*   Original Passport.
*   Valid Visit Visa (stamp in passport).
*   Home Country Driving License.
*   International Driving Permit (IDP) - *if your country is not exempt*.

### 2. Payment Methods
*   **Flexible:** Unlike strict international agencies, many local suppliers on AUTO.AE accept **Cash** and **Debit Cards** for payments and deposits.
*   **Currency:** Payments are typically in AED.

### 3. Navigation
*   Google Maps and Waze work perfectly in UAE.
*   Download the "Offline Maps" area for Dubai before you leave your hotel Wi-Fi to save roaming data.

## Important tips
*   **Tolls (Salik):** You don't pay tolls as you drive. The agency pays them and charges you at the end (usually 5 AED per gate pass).
*   **Parking:** Parking is paid almost everywhere. Use the "Dubai Drive" app or SMS parking (requires a local SIM).
*   **Strict Laws:** Zero tolerance for alcohol. Do not drink and drive.

## Common mistakes
*   **Thinking "I can drive because I own a property":** If you are a Resident (have a residency visa), you CANNOT use your tourist license rules. You must convert to a UAE license.
*   **Missing IDP:** If your license is not in English or Arabic, you almost certainly need an IDP.
