# Renting: Insurance for Rentals

## Overview
Driving a rental car in the UAE is generally safe, but accidents happen. The level of insurance you choose determines whether a scratch costs you nothing or 2000 AED. This page explains the standard insurance included on **AUTO.AE** bookings and optional upgrades.

## What this page covers
*   Basic Comprehensive Insurance (Standard).
*   CDW (Collision Damage Waiver) upgrades.
*   What to do in an accident (Police Report).

## Key concepts explained
| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Comprehensive** | Covers damage to the rental car AND the other car, *but* you still pay the Excess fee if you are at fault. |
| **Police Report** | A mandatory document from Dubai Police/Saeed. Without it, insurance pays nothing. |
| **Unknown Damage** | If you find a scratch in a parking lot but don't know who did it, you are considered "At Fault" by default unless you pay for a police report. |

## Insurance Levels

### 1. Basic Insurance (Included)
Every legal rental car in the UAE comes with this.
*   **Coverage:** Personal injury + vehicle damage.
*   **Your Risk:** You pay the "Excess" (e.g., 1000 AED) if you are at fault. You pay nothing if the other driver is at fault (Red slip).

### 2. CDW (Full Coverage)
An optional daily fee (e.g., +20 AED/day) paid to the agency.
*   **benefit:** Reduces your "Excess" to ZERO.
*   **Coverage:** If you crash, you walk away without paying for repairs (Terms apply: Usually excludes tires/glass).

## Important tips
*   **Always Call the Police:** Even for a tiny scratch. In Dubai, use the app for minor accidents. No report = No insurance cover. You will pay 100% of repairs out of pocket.
*   **Check Glass & Tires:** Most standard policies EXCLUDE tire punctures and windshield cracks.

## Common mistakes
*   **Driving Off-Road:** Standard rental insurance is void if you drive on sand/dunes. You need a specialized 4x4 rental agreement for that.
*   **Under-25 Drivers:** Young drivers often pay a higher Excess (e.g., +10%) mandated by insurance companies.
