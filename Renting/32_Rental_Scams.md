## The Scam List

### 1. The "New Scratch" Trick
You return the car. The agent walks specifically to a hidden spot under the bumper and finding a scratch.
*   **The Trap:** "Oh, you scratched it. That will be 500 AED cash now, or we deduct 1000 from the deposit."
*   **The Defense:** Show them the video you took at pickup. If they persist, say "Call the police, let's file a report." Scammers will back down immediately.

### 2. The Held Passport
"We need to keep your passport until you return the car."
*   **The Trap:** If you dispute a charge later, they threaten not to give your passport back before your flight.
*   **The Defense:** Never give your passport. Offer a clear photocopy or find another agency.

### 3. The Cash Deposit Vanishing Act
You pay a 1000 AED cash deposit. When you return the car, they say "Come back next week for the cash." You come back, "The manager is out." You come back again, the shop is closed.
*   **The Defense:** Always use a Credit Card. Raise a dispute with your bank if they don't refund.

## Important tips
*   **Check Reviews:** If an agency has 1-star reviews saying "Stole my deposit", believe them.
*   **Official Contract:** Ensure you sign a printed contract with a header/logo. A handwritten note on blank paper is invalid.
