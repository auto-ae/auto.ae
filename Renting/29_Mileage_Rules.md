# Renting: Mileage Rules

## Overview
Every car rental on **AUTO.AE** comes with a specific mileage allowance. This is the maximum distance you can drive without paying a penalty. AUTO.AE suppliers often offer higher mileage limits (e.g., 300km/day) compared to international airport agencies.

## Key concepts explained
| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Unlimited Mileage** | A rare feature where you can drive as much as you want. Usually costs extra. |
| **Excess Mileage Charge** | The fee you pay for every kilometer over the limit (e.g., 2 AED/km). |

## Standard Limits on AUTO.AE

### 1. Daily Rentals
*   **Standard:** 250 - 300 km / day.
*   **Comparison:** Many international chains only offer 175-200 km/day.
*   **Sufficient for:** City driving, one round trip to Abu Dhabi.

### 2. Monthly Rentals
*   **Standard:** 3000 - 5000 km / month.
*   **Calculation:** Unlike daily rentals, this is a "bucket". You can drive 500km on Day 1 and 0km on Day 2. As long as the *total* at the end of the month is within the limit, you pay nothing extra.

### 3. Exceeding the Limit
If the limit is 300km and you drive 350km:
*   Extra: 50 km.
*   Rate: ~2 AED/km (varies by car luxury level).
*   **You Pay:** 100 AED extra upon return.

## Important tips
*   **High Milers:** If you have a long commute (e.g., Dubai to Abu Dhabi daily), you WILL exceed 300km/day. Negotiate a custom package or pay for "Unlimited Mileage" upfront.
*   **Track It:** Reset your trip counter (Trip A) when you pick up the car. Take a photo of the odometer.
