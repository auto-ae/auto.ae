# Renting: Mileage Rules

## Overview
Every car rental on **AUTO.AE** comes with a specific mileage allowance. This is the maximum distance you can drive without paying a penalty. Understanding these limits is crucial if you plan to drive between Emirates (e.g., Dubai to Abu Dhabi daily).

## What this page covers
*   How mileage is calculated.
*   Standard limits for Daily vs Monthly.
*   Cost of exceeding the limit.

## Key concepts explained
| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Unlimited Mileage** | A rare feature where you can drive as much as you want. Usually costs extra. |
| **Additional Km Charge** | The fee you pay for every kilometer over the limit (e.g., 0.50 AED/km). |

## Standard Limits

### 1. Daily Rentals
*   **Standard:** 250 km / day.
*   **Sufficient for:** City driving, one round trip to Abu Dhabi.
*   **Not sufficient for:** Cross-country road trips or delivery jobs.

### 2. Monthly Rentals
*   **Standard:** 3000 - 5000 km / month.
*   **Calculation:** Unlike daily rentals, this is a "bucket". You can drive 500km on Day 1 and 0km on Day 2. As long as the *total* at the end of the month is within the limit, you pay nothing extra.

### 3. Exceeding the Limit
If the limit is 250km and you drive 300km:
*   Extra: 50 km.
*   Rate: 0.50 AED/km.
*   **You Pay:** 25 AED extra upon return.

## Important tips
*   **Negotiate:** If you are booking a monthly rental, ask the agency: "Can you bump the limit to 5000km?". Many will agree to close the deal.
*   **Check the Contract:** Some flashy "Low Price" deals might achieve that price by lowering the limit to 150 km/day. Be careful.
