# Renting: Deposits and Refunds

## Overview
The security deposit is the most misunderstood part of renting a car. It is not an extra fee, but a "block" on your money to cover potential future costs like traffic fines (Salik/radar). This page explains how deposits work on **AUTO.AE** and when you will get your money back.

*   Why refunds take 15-30 days.
*   Deductions for fines and Salik.

## Key concepts explained
| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Pre-Auth** | The money is not taken from your account, but "frozen". You cannot spend it, but it doesn't appear as a charge on your monthly statement until finalized. |
| **RTA Fines** | Speeding/Parking tickets. These sometimes take a few days to appear in the system, which is why agencies hold the deposit. |

## The Refund Timeline

### 1. Booking
You swipe your card. ~1000 AED is blocked.

### 2. Return Car
You hand back the keys. The agency checks for new scratches.
*   *Safe:* No damage found.
*   *Damage:* Estimated repair cost is noted.

### 3. The Waiting Period (15 - 30 Days)
This is mandatory in the UAE. The agency waits to see if any traffic fines arrive from the days you drove.
*   *Note:* Fines can sometimes take weeks to be registered by the police system.

### 4. Release
*   **If no fines:** The block is released automatically by the bank.
*   **If fines found:** The agency charges the fine amount + administrative fee, and releases the rest.

## Important tips
*   **Credit is Better:** Use a Credit Card, not a Debit Card. Credit card blocks disappear silently. Debit card refunds require an actual transaction and can take longer to reflect.
*   **Ask for Proof:** If an agency deducts money for a fine, ask for the official Police/RTA fine receipt time-stamped during your rental period.

## Common mistakes
*   **Closing your Bank Account:** Don't close your account immediately after leaving Dubai if you have a pending deposit refund.
*   **Thinking "Cash is Faster":** Cash deposits rely on the agency manually wiring money back to you. This often involves delays and "come back tomorrow" excuses.
