# Renting: Deposits and Refunds

## Overview
The security deposit is the most misunderstood part of renting a car. It is not an extra fee, but a "block" on your money to cover potential future costs like traffic fines (Salik/radar). **AUTO.AE** offers unique features like "No Deposit" filters which are rare in the traditional market.

## Key concepts explained
| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **No Deposit** | A filter on AUTO.AE where sellers waive the security deposit requirement completely. Highly popular for short-term rentals. |
| **Pre-Auth** | The money is not taken from your account, but "frozen". You cannot spend it, but it doesn't appear as a charge on your monthly statement until finalized. |
| **Cash Deposit** | A physical cash amount held by the agency. Unlike international chains, many local suppliers on AUTO.AE accept cash deposits. |

## The Refund Timeline

### 1. Booking
*   **Standard:** You swipe your card. ~1000 - 2000 AED is blocked.
*   **No Deposit:** You pay 0 AED security deposit (if you selected this filter).

### 2. Return Car
You hand back the keys. The agency checks for new scratches.
*   *Safe:* No damage found.
*   *Damage:* Estimated repair cost is deducted or noted.

### 3. The Waiting Period (21 - 30 Days)
This is mandatory in the UAE. The agency waits to see if any RTA traffic fines arrive from the days you drove.
*   *Note:* Fines can sometimes take weeks to be registered by the police system.

### 4. Release
*   **Credit Card:** The block is released automatically by the bank.
*   **Cash:** You must return to the office or receive a bank transfer.

## Important tips
*   **Use the Filter:** If you are short on cash, use the **"No Deposit"** filter on AUTO.AE to find cars that don't require blocking funds.
*   **Credit is Safer:** Credit card blocks disappear silently. Cash deposits often require you to chase the agency for a wire transfer refund.

## Common mistakes
*   **Closing your Bank Account:** Don't close your account immediately after leaving Dubai if you have a pending deposit refund.
*   **Expecting Instant Refunds:** Even if you drove perfectly, the RTA fine checking period (21+ days) is standard across the country.
