# Renting: Searching Rental Cars

## Overview
Searching for a rental car is slightly different from buying one. Instead of looking for "Model Year", you are often looking for "Availability" and "Rate". The **AUTO.AE** Rental section is streamlined to help you find a car that fits your schedule and budget.

## What this page covers
*   Filtering by Daily vs Monthly rates.
*   Finding specific car types (Van, SUV, Convertible).
*   Sorting by "Lowest Price".

## Key concepts explained
| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Grid Rate** | The price displayed on the search card. Usually shows the *Daily* rate by default. |
| **Fleet** | Rental cars are part of a fleet. You might book a "Toyota Camry 2023" but receive a "Toyota Camry 2024" (or similar category) depending on availability. |

## Search Guide

### 1. Switch to "Rent"
Click the **"Rent a Car"** tab in the header. The search bar logic changes to focus on rental terms.

### 2. Choose Duration Type
Decide if you need the car for a few days or a month.
*   **Daily:** Best for tourists or weekend trips.
*   **Monthly:** Offers significant discounts (30-50% cheaper per day).
*   *How to:* Use the "Period" filter to toggle prices.

### 3. Select Car Type
*   **Economy:** Cheap, fuel-efficient (e.g., Picanto, Sunny).
*   **SUV:** For families or desert trips (e.g., Patrol, Land Cruiser).
*   **Luxury/Sport:** For special occasions (e.g., Ferrari, Rolls Royce).

### 4. Filter by Location
Select your Emirate (Dubai, Abu Dhabi, etc.). Most agencies will deliver, but searching locally saves delivery fees.

## Important tips
*   **Book Early:** On weekends and holidays (Eid, National Day), rental prices spike and availability drops. Book 3-4 days in advance.
*   **Read the Description:** Does the price include VAT? Is there a mileage limit? (e.g., "250 km included").

## Common mistakes
*   **Comparing Daily Price vs Monthly Price:** Don't compare a 100 AED/day offer with a 2000 AED/month offer without doing the math. 2000/30 = ~66 AED/day. Monthly is cheaper.
*   **Ignoring the Deposit:** You might find a cheap Ferrari rental, but do you have a 5000 AED deposit limit available on your card?
