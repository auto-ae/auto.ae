## Key concepts explained
| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Green Slip** | A police report stating you are **NOT** at fault. You pay nothing. |
| **Red Slip** | A police report stating you **ARE** at fault. You pay the Excess fee. |
| **Unknown Slip** | Damage caused by an unknown party (e.g., in a parking lot). Treated as Red Slip (At Fault) unless you prove otherwise. |

## Step-by-Step Accident Guide

### 1. Stop and Assess
*   Move the car to the shoulder if possible.
*   If major injury: Call **999** (Ambulance/Police).
*   If minor damage (no injury): Call **901** (Non-emergency) or use the Smart App.

### 2. File the Report
*   **Dubai:** Use the Dubai Police App. Upload photos of both cars.
*   **Other Emirates:** Wait for the patrol car to arrive (Saeed).

### 3. Contact the Rental Agency
*   Send them the PDF report immediately via WhatsApp.
*   Do **NOT** repair the car yourself at a garage. It is illegal for a garage to touch a car without a police slip.

### 4. Pay the Excess (If Red Slip)
*   If you caused the crash, the agency will charge the "Excess" amount agreed in your contract (e.g., 1000 AED).
*   If you have a Green Slip, you pay 0 AED.

## Important tips
*   **Don't Argue with the Other Driver:** It's useless. Let the police decide who is at fault based on the photos.
*   **Replacement Car:** Most standard contracts only offer a replacement car if the accident was NOT your fault. If you caused it, you might be walking until your contract ends.

## Common mistakes
*   **Leaving the Scene:** Never drive away. "Hit and Run" is a serious crime.
*   **Delaying the Report:** You cannot file a "yesterday accident" report easily. Do it on the spot.
