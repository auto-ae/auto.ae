# Renting: Rental Listing Page

## Overview
The rental listing card contains critical information hidden in small details. Unlike buying a car where the focus is on the chassis history, here the focus is on the **Contract Terms**. Reading this page correctly saves you from hidden fees and mileage penalties.

## What this page covers
*   Understanding "Excess" and "CDW".
*   Mileage limits per day/month.
*   Deposit requirements.

## Key concepts explained
| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **CDW (Collision Damage Waiver)** | Optional extra insurance. If you buy this, your liability in an accident drops to Zero (usually). |
| **Excess Claim** | The amount you pay if you cause an accident. If Excess is 1000 AED, and damage is 5000 AED, you pay 1000, insurance pays 4000. |

## Listing Logic

### 1. The Price Tag
Shows *two* potential prices:
*   **Daily Rate:** If you book for < 30 days.
*   **Monthly Rate:** If you commit to a full month.
*   *Note:* VAT (5%) is usually added on top of this price.

### 2. Mileage Allowance
Look for the text "250 km / day" or "5000 km / month".
*   If you drive more, you pay extra (e.g., 0.50 AED per extra km).

### 3. Requirements Section
Lists the non-negotiables:
*   Minimum Age: 21, 23, or 25.
*   Deposit Amount: e.g., "1500 AED via Credit Card".

### 4. Features
*   **Free Delivery:** Does the agency bring the car to you?
*   **Insurance Included:** Basic comprehensive is standard, but check for "Full Coverage".

## Important tips
*   **Check the Year:** Rental fleets vary. A "Camry" listing might be a 2020 model or a 2024 model. The year is clearly listed.
*   **Read the Reviews:** Click the Agency name to see if previous renters had issues with deposit refunds.

## Common mistakes
*   **Booking "Debit Card" Rentals:** Some listings say "No Credit Card Required", but these often have higher daily rates or strict cash deposits.
*   **Ignoring the Excess:** Renting a cheap car with a huge 5000 AED excess risk is a bad gamble.
