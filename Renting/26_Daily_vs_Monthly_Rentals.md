## Key concepts explained
| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Mini-Lease** | Treating a monthly rental as a substitute for owning a car. You pay month-to-month with no long-term bank loan. |
| **Pro-Rata Refund** | If you return a monthly rental early (e.g., after 2 weeks), most agencies will recalculate the price at the *Daily* rate, meaning you get very little refund. |

## Comparison Table

| Feature | Daily Rental | Monthly Rental |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **Cost Efficiency** | 💰 Expensive (~100 AED/day) | 💰 **Best Value** (~1500 AED/month = 50 AED/day) |
| **Commitment** | 🟢 None (Return anytime) | 🟠 Medium (1 month lock) |
| **Mileage Limit** | 📉 ~250 km/day | 📈 ~4000-5000 km/month |
| **Deposit Return** | ⏳ 21-30 days | ⏳ 21-30 days after final return |
| **Flexibility** | ✅ Swap cars daily | ❌ Same car for 30 days |

## Important tips
*   **The "Break-Even" Point:** Usually, if you need a car for more than 18-20 days, it is cheaper to book a Monthly plan than to pay the Daily rate for 3 weeks.
*   **Extension:** You can usually extend a Daily rental to a Monthly one by calling the agency, but agree on the rate *before* the first week ends.
