## Important tips
*   **Don't Rush the Checking:** When the driver arrives, they will be in a hurry. **Stop them.** Walk around the car. Record a video. Note every scratch on the paper form they give you. Once they leave, any "new" scratch is your problem.
*   **Fuel Level:** Check the fuel gauge immediately upon delivery. It should match what is written on the contract.
