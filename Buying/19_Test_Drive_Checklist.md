# Buying: Test Drive Checklist

## Overview
A car might pass a visual inspection but fail on the road. The test drive is your chance to feel how the car behaves under load. Turn off the radio, open your ears, and follow this checklist to ensure the car is mechanically sound.

## Key concepts explained
| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Transmission Slip** | When the engine RPM goes up but the speed doesn't increase instantly. Indicates a failing gearbox. |
| **Alignment** | If the car pulls to the left or right when driving straight. |

## The Drive

### 1. Low Speed (Parking Lot)
*   **Steering:** Turn the wheel fully left and fully right while moving slowly. Listen for "clicking" or "clunking" sounds (Signs of CV joint failure).
*   **Brakes:** Tap the brakes. Do they squeak?

### 2. City Driving (Speed Bumps)
Dubai roads are full of speed bumps. Use them to your advantage:
*   **Suspension:** Go over a bump with the windows down. A "squeak" or "crunch" sound means dried-out bushings (common in hot climates).
*   **Mounts:** Shift from D to R while stopped. A heavy "thud" suggests broken engine mounts.

### 3. Highway Run (120 km/h)
Get on Sheikh Zayed Road or Al Khail Road.
*   **Vibration:** Shaking at 120 km/h usually means wheel balance issues or bent rims.
*   **Wind Noise:** Excessive noise might mean the car was in an accident and the door seals don't fit perfectly anymore.

### 4. Cooling Test
*   After the drive, leave the car running for 5 minutes. Watch the temperature gauge. Does it creep up? (Overheating is common in GCC summers).

## Important tips
*   **Drive it Cold:** Ensure the engine is cold when you start. Many problems disappear once the oil is warm.
*   **Turn off the Radio:** Keep the cabin silent to hear mechanical noises.
