# Buying: Test Drive Checklist

## Overview
A car might pass a visual inspection but fail on the road. The test drive is your chance to feel how the car behaves under load. Turn off the radio, open your ears, and follow this checklist to ensure the car is mechanically sound.

## Key concepts explained
| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Transmission Slip** | When the engine RPM goes up but the speed doesn't increase instantly. Indicates a failing gearbox. |
| **Alignment** | If the car pulls to the left or right when driving straight. |

## The Drive

### 1. Low Speed (Parking Lot)
*   **Steering:** Turn the wheel fully left and fully right while moving slowly. Listen for "clicking" or "clunking" sounds (Signs of CV joint failure).
*   **Brakes:** Tap the brakes. Do they squeak?

### 2. City Driving (40-60 km/h)
*   **Shifting:** In an automatic car, do the gears change smoothly? Or is there a "jerk"?
*   **Bumps:** Drive over a speed bump. A loud "bang" means worn shocks or bushings.

### 3. Highway Driving (100+ km/h)
*   **Vibration:** Does the steering wheel shake at high speed? (Could be wheel balance or bent rims).
*   **Noise:** Listen for a "humming" sound (Wheel bearing failure).

### 4. Cooling Test
*   After the drive, leave the car running for 5 minutes. Watch the temperature gauge. Does it creep up? (Overheating is common in GCC summers).

## Visual example


## Important tips
*   **Drive it Cold:** Ensure the engine is cold when you start. Many problems disappear once the oil is warm.
*   **Turn off the Radio:** Keep the cabin silent to hear mechanical noises.
