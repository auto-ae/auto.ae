# Buying: Inspection Checklist

## Overview
You should never buy a used car without inspecting it in person (or hiring a professional to do so). Photos can be edited, but the car in front of you cannot lie. Print this checklist or use it on your phone when engaging with a seller from **AUTO.AE**.

## Key concepts explained
| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Coolant** | Fluid that keeps the engine cool. Oil in the coolant is a sign of a blown head gasket (expensive repair). |
| **Tread Depth** | The depth of the tire grooves. Less than 3mm is unsafe and needs replacement. |

## The Checklist

### 1. Exterior
*   [ ] **Paint Consistency:** Walk around the car. Is one door slightly darker?
*   [ ] **Tires:** Check the manufacturing date code on the tires (e.g., "2623" means week 26 of 2023). Tires older than 3-4 years need replacing in UAE heat.
*   [ ] **Glass:** Check windshield for cracks.
*   [ ] **Lines:** Are the gaps between the hood and fenders even on both sides?

### 2. Under the Hood
*   [ ] **Leaks:** Look for wet spots or oil grime on the engine block.
*   [ ] **Fluid Levels:** Check oil and coolant. Low levels suggest neglect.
*   [ ] **Belts:** Are the rubber belts cracked or frayed?

### 3. Interior & Electronics
*   [ ] **AC:** Turn it on MAX immediately. It should be freezing cold within 1 minute. **Critical in GCC.**
*   [ ] **Windows:** Test all 4 windows up and down.
*   [ ] **Smell:** A damp/mildew smell indicates past flooding. A heavy perfume smell might be masking mold.

### 4. Start Up
*   [ ] **Cold Start:** Ask the seller not to warm up the car before you arrive. Listen for rattling noises when starting cold.
*   [ ] **Smoke:** Look at the exhaust. Blue smoke = oil burning. White smoke = coolant leak.

## Important tips
*   **Bring a Flashlight:** Even in daylight, looking under the car or into the engine bay requires light.
*   **Meet in Public:** Always inspect the car in a safe, public location or at the seller's home.
