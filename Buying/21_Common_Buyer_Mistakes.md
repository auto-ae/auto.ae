## The Mistakes List

### 1. Buying "Blind"
Purchasing a car based only on photos because the price was low.
*   *Reality:* Photos hide scratches, dents, and strange smells.

### 2. Ignoring "Export" Status
Buying a car listed as "For Export" thinking you can drive it in the UAE.
*   *Reality:* These cars often cannot be registered locally due to emissions or safety regulations.

### 3. Forgetting Registration Costs
Budgeting exactly 50,000 AED for a 50,000 AED car.
*   *Reality:* You need ~2000-3000 AED extra for Insurance, Registration, and Testing fees.

### 4. Trusting a "Clean" Dashboard
Assuming the car is fine because no warning lights are on.
*   *Reality:* Unscrupulous sellers can disconnect the bulb for the "Check Engine" light or clear the codes temporarily. Always scan the OBD.

## Important tips
*   **Sleep on It:** Never sign a deal under pressure. If the seller says "I have another buyer coming in 10 minutes", let them come.
*   **Check the Spare Key:** A replacement modern key can cost 2000 AED. Ask for both keys.
