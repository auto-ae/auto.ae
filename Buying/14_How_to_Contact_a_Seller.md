*   Safety precautions when sharing personal info.

## Key concepts explained
| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Masked Number** | Some sellers stick to in-app chat only and do not reveal their phone number initially. |
| **In-App Chat** | The built-in messaging system on AUTO.AE. It is the safest way to communicate as chats are monitored for spam. |

## Contact Methods

### 1. WhatsApp (Recommended)
Most popular in the UAE.
*   **Pros:** Fast, allows sharing location pins and extra photos easily.
*   **How:** Click the green **"WhatsApp"** button on the listing.
    *   *Example:* If contacting **ALO CARS USED CARS LLC**, this will open a chat directly with their sales representative.

### 2. Phone Call
Best for serious, urgent buyers.
*   **Pros:** Immediate answer, hear the seller's tone.
*   **How:** Click **"Call"**. The number will be revealed (e.g., +971 50 XXXXXXX).

### 3. In-App Chat
Best for initial inquiries if you don't want to share your number yet.
*   **Pros:** Keeps your privacy.
*   **How:** Type your message in the chat box on the listing page. You will get a push notification when they reply.

## Important tips
*   **Be Polite:** A simple "Is the car available?" is better than just sending a lowball offer "50k?" working as a first message.
*   **Check Business Hours:** If contacting a specific Showroom, check their hours. They might not answer WhatsApp at 11 PM.

## Common mistakes
*   **Asking details already in the description:** Read the description first. Asking "Does it have a sunroof?" when the ad says "Panoramic Sunroof" shows you are not serious.
*   **Sharing OTPs:** Never share any verification code (OTP) with a seller. Real sellers never ask for this.
