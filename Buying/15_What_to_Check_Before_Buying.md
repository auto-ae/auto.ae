## What this page covers
*   Analyzing listing photos for hidden damage.
*   Understanding value vs price.
*   Checking seller credibility.

## Key concepts explained
| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Panel Gap** | The space between car body parts (e.g., hood and fender). Uneven gaps suggest a previous accident. |
| **Odometer Rollback** | The illegal practice of winding back the mileage counter to make the car look newer. |

## Digital Checklist

### 1. Photo Analysis
*   **Mismatched Paint:** Look closely at the doors vs the bumper. Is one shade slightly different?
*   **Worn Interior:** Does a car with only "20,000 km" have a torn driver's seat and shiny steering wheel? That's a red flag for odometer rollback.
*   **Dashboard Lights:** Zoom in on the dashboard photo. Is the "Check Engine" light on?

### 2. Price Logic
*   **Too Good to Be True:** If a 2024 Model is listed for 50% less than the market average, it is likely a scam or a flood-damaged car.
*   **Compare:** Open 3 similar tabs to see the average price range.

### 3. Seller History
*   Click on the **Seller's Name**.
*   Do they have 50 other cheap cars listed? They might be a "curbstoner" (unlicensed dealer posing as private seller).

### 4. Description Quality
*   "Perfect condition, lady driven" is a cliché.
*   Look for specific details: "Serviced at Agency last month", "New tires installed in June". Specifics = Trust.

## Important tips
*   **Ask for the VIN:** If the VIN is not listed, message the seller: "Can you share the chassis number?". If they refuse, walk away.
*   **Google the Phone Number:** Search the seller's number. Does it show up on other forums or complaint sites?

## Common mistakes
*   **Falling for "Urgent Sale":** Scammers often use "Leaving the country tomorrow, must sell!" to pressure you into skipping checks.
*   **Ignoring Import Status:** A "US Spec" car in Dubai requires a CARFAX check. Do not buy it blind.
