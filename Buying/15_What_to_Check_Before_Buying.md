## Key concepts explained
| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Panel Gap** | The space between car body parts (e.g., hood and fender). Uneven gaps suggest a previous accident. |
| **Odometer Rollback** | The illegal practice of winding back the mileage counter to make the car look newer. |

## Digital Checklist

### 1. Photo Analysis
*   **GCC vs Import:** Look for the "GCC Specs" sticker on the door jam. If not providing it, ask "Is this US Spec?".
*   **Mismatched Paint:** Intense sunlight in UAE fades paint. If one door looks "newer" than the rest, it was likely repainted after an accident.
*   **Dashboard Lights:** Zoom in. Is the "Check Engine" or "Airbag" light taped over?

### 2. Digital History Check
*   **MOI Check:** Use the chassis number (VIN) on the **Ministry of Interior** website to see recorded accidents.
*   **EVG / Emirates Vehicle Gate:** Check for unpaid fines or impound notices.

### 3. Seller Credibility
*   **Multiple Listings:** If a "Private Seller" has 10 cars listed, they are likely an unlicensed trader.
*   **Price Logic:** If a 2024 Patrol is listed for 50k AED, it is a scam (or a total loss).

## Important tips
*   **Ask for the VIN:** If the VIN is not listed, message the seller: "Can you share the chassis number?". If they refuse, walk away.
*   **Google the Phone Number:** Search the seller's number. Does it show up on other forums or complaint sites?

## Common mistakes
*   **Falling for "Urgent Sale":** Scammers often use "Leaving the country tomorrow, must sell!" to pressure you into skipping checks.
*   **Ignoring Import Status:** A "US Spec" car in Dubai requires a CARFAX check. Do not buy it blind.
