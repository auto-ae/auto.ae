## Step-by-step guide

### 1. Select the "Buy" Tab
Ensure you are in the correct marketplace by clicking **"Buy a Car"** in the main header or app navigation.

### 2. Enter Keywords
Use the main search bar to type anything:
*   *Brand:* "Toyota"
*   *Model:* "Land Cruiser"
*   *Features:* "Sunroof", "Leather"
*   *Press Enter* to see initial results.

### 3. Browse and Sort
Once the results load, use the "Sort" dropdown (usually top right) to organize them:
*   **Price: Low to High** – Good for finding bargains.
*   **Price: High to Low** – Good for finding luxury/premium trims.
*   **Most Recent** – Crucial for catching fresh deals before they sell.

### 4. Click to View

## Important tips
*   **Save Your Search:** If you don't find what you want today, click the "Bell" icon to get notified when new cars match your search.
*   **Check the Date:** Look at the "Listed" date. Cars listed > 3 months ago might be sold or have negotiable prices.

## Common mistakes
*   **Searching in "Rent":** Ensure you didn't accidentally click the "Rent" tab, or you will see daily rates instead of sales prices.
*   **Typing too much:** Instead of "I want a red car", just type "Red". The search is keyword-based.
