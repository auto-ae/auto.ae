# Buying: VIN and History Basics

## Overview
A car might look shiny on the outside but have a disastrous history underneath. The **VIN (Vehicle Identification Number)** is the car's fingerprint. Using this code to check the vehicle's history is the single most important step in avoiding lemons, previously crashed cars, or flooded vehicles.

## Key concepts explained
| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **VIN / Chassis No.** | A 17-character unique code composed of letters and numbers. |
| **Salvage Title** | A car that was declared a "Total Loss" by insurance (usually due to a major accident or flood) but was rebuilt. |
| **EVG / MOI** | Official UAE government portals to check local accident history. |

## How to Check

### 1. Get the VIN
*   It is located on the dashboard (visible through the windshield) or on the driver's door pillar sticker.
*   On **AUTO.AE**, sellers often list it in the "Specifications" section.

### 2. Check GCC History (Local Cars)
If the car is "GCC Specs", use these official, free government portals:
*   **MOI (Ministry of Interior):** Enter the VIN to see all recorded accidents across the UAE (except some older Dubai data).
*   **EVG (Emirates Vehicle Gate):** Shows unpaid fines, insurance history, and impound status.
*   **Abu Dhabi Police:** Essential if the car was ever registered in Abu Dhabi.

### 3. Check Import History (US/Canada/Japan)
If the car is **"North American Specs"**, assume it was crashed unless proven otherwise.
*   **The Golden Rule:** 90% of US-spec cars in UAE are repaired salvage title (accident/flood).
*   **Google the VIN:** You will likely find photos of the car in a US scrapyard (Copart/IAAI).
*   **CARFAX:** Mandatory for peace of mind.

## Important tips
*   **"Clean Title" Trap:** A car can have a "Clean Title" in the US but still have accidents. Read the full report.
*   **Japanese Imports:** These are harder to check as Japanese history reports are less detailed than US ones. Verify with a physical inspection.

## Common mistakes
*   **Trusting the Seller's Verbal Word:** "No accidents, habibi, believe me." Never rely on this. Trust the database.
*   **Checking Only One Source:** A car might be clean in the UAE (EVG) but was crashed in the US before import. Check both if applicable.
