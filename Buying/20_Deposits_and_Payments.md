## Key concepts explained
| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Deposit** | A small amount (usually 500-2000 AED) paid to reserve the car while you arrange finance or insurance. |
| **Sales Agreement** | A written contract signed by both parties stating the deposit is refundable if the car fails inspection. |

## Payment Methods

### 1. Deposits
*   **Rule #1:** Never pay a deposit before seeing the car.
*   **Method:** Cash is best, with a written receipt. Avoid bank transfers to personal accounts for deposits unless you have a signed contract.

### 2. Final Payment
*   **Cash:** The most common method for private sales. Exchange money inside the RTA/Traffic office *at the moment of transfer*.
*   **Manager's Cheque:** For large amounts, a bank-issued cheque guarantees funds. Safer than carrying 100k cash.
*   **Bank Transfer:** Only transfer once the car is in your name, or use a trusted showroom as an intermediary.

## Visual example


## Important tips
*   **Meet at the RTA:** The safest place to pay is at the government registration center. Hand over the cash exactly when the officer asks "Do you agree to transfer?".
*   **Get a Receipt:** Even for 500 AED. Write "Refundable if engine fails test" on the paper.

## Common mistakes
*   **Transferring money for "Shipping":** If a seller says "Car is in UK, send money for shipping", IT IS A SCAM.
*   **Paying without a Title Check:** Ensure the person selling the car actually owns it (Name on ID matches Registration Card).
