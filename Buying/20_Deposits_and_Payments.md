## Key concepts explained
| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Deposit** | A small amount (usually 500-2000 AED) paid to reserve the car while you arrange finance or insurance. |
| **Sales Agreement** | A written contract signed by both parties stating the deposit is refundable if the car fails inspection. |

## Payment Methods

### 1. Deposits
*   **Rule #1:** Never pay a deposit before seeing the car.
*   **Method:** Cash is best, with a written receipt. Avoid bank transfers to personal accounts for deposits unless you have a signed contract.

### 3. Final Payment
*   **Cash:** The standard for private deals. Exchange cash **inside the RTA/Tasjeel center**, immediately after the officer stamps "Transferred".
*   **Manager's Cheque:** Safer for amounts over 50k AED. Verify the cheque at the bank if possible.
*   **Bank Transfer:** Only transfer **after** the car registration card (Mulkiya) is in your name.

## Important tips
*   **The "Transfer" Moment:** The exact moment ownership changes is when the RTA agent prints the new Mulkiya. Do not hand over cash before this step.
*   **Deposit Receipt:** If paying a booking fee, write a simple paper: "Deposit of 1000 AED for Car VIN XYZ. Refundable if Tasjeel test fails." Both parties sign.

## Common mistakes
*   **Transferring money for "Shipping":** If a seller says "Car is in UK, send money for shipping", IT IS A SCAM.
*   **Paying without a Title Check:** Ensure the person selling the car actually owns it (Name on ID matches Registration Card).
