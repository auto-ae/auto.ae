## Main Filters Guide

### 1. Basic Details
*   **Make & Model:** Select "Toyota", then "Land Cruiser" (or other popular models like "Nissan Patrol").
*   **Price Range:** Use the preset brackets found on the site:
    *   *Budget:* Up to 100,000 AED
    *   *Mid:* Up to 300,000 AED
    *   *Luxury:* Up to 1,000,000 AED
    *   *Exclusive:* Up to 20,000,000 AED

### 2. Technical Specs & Tags
*   **Regional Specs:**
    *   *GCC Specs:* Built for Gulf heat (larger radiators, improved AC). **Highly recommended**.
    *   *Import:* (American/Japanese/Euro) – Generally cheaper but require careful checking.
*   **Valuable Tags:** Look for listings marked with:
    *   **"Dealer maintained"** (Service history verified)
    *   **"Urgent"** (Motivated seller)
    *   **"Fully loaded"** (Top option package)

### 3. Condition & History
*   **Mileage:** Limit the max km driven.
*   **Seller Type:** Filter to see only "Dealer" stock or "Owner" listings.

## Important tips
*   **Don't Over-filter:** If you select "Red color" + "2023" + "Specific Trim", you might get 0 results. Start broad and narrow down.
*   **Use the "Verified" Filter:** Toggle this to see listings only from trusted showrooms to save time.

## Common mistakes
*   **Ignoring Import Specs:** Buying an "American Spec" car without checking its VIN. Many are salvaged/repaired cars.
*   **Confusing "Model Year" with "Registration Date":** A 2020 model might be registered in 2021. The filter uses the *Model Year*.
