*   How to use flaws as leverage.

## Key concepts explained
| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Lowballing** | Making an offensively low offer (e.g., offering 30k for a car listed at 60k). This usually gets you blocked. |
| **Last Price** | A common phrase sellers use, meaning the absolute minimum they will accept. |

## The Strategy

### 1. Research First
Before you create an offer, look at 5 other similar cars on AUTO.AE.
*   *Car A:* 55,000 AED
*   *Car B:* 52,000 AED
*   *Target Car:* Listed at 58,000 AED.
*   *Conclusion:* You have room to negotiate down to ~53,000.

### 2. The "Last Price" Culture
In the UAE, asking "What is your last price?" is standard, but doing it too early is ineffective.
*   *Bad:* Sending "Last Price?" as the very first message.
*   *Good:* Inspecting the car, finding a flaw, and then saying: "I like the car, but it needs tires. What is your best price for cash today?"

### 3. The "Tasjeel" Negotiation
Often, the final negotiation happens **at the testing center**.
*   If the RTA test result shows "Chassis Minor" or "Oil Leak", use this official report to ask for a 1,000-2,000 AED discount on the spot.

### 4. Use Flaws as Leverage
During the inspection (or after seeing detailed photos), point out valid issues to justify your lower offer:
*   "The tires are 3 years old, I'll need to spend 2000 AED to replace them."
*   "There is a scratch on the bumper."

### 5. The "Walk Away"
If the seller is stuck on a high price, politely decline and wait. If they are motivated to sell, they might message you back in a few days.

## Important tips
*   **Cash is King:** Sellers prefer cash buyers over bank finance buyers because it's faster. Mention "I have cash ready" to get a better deal.
*   **Be Respectful:** "50k cash now" is rude. "Would you consider 50,000 if I finish the deal today?" is professional.

## Common mistakes
*   **Negotiating text-only:** You will always get a better deal in person. It is harder for a seller to say "no" to cash in hand.
*   **Comparing Apples to Oranges:** Don't tell a seller "I saw a cheaper one" if the cheaper one has double the mileage.
