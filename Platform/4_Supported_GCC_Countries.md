## The 6 GCC Nations

AUTO.AE supports listings and users from the following countries:

1.  **🇦🇪 United Arab Emirates (UAE):** The primary hub. Covers all 7 emirates (Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm Al Quwain, Ras Al Khaimah, Fujairah).
2.  **🇸🇦 Saudi Arabia (KSA):** Key market for SUVs and luxury imports.
3.  **🇶🇦 Qatar:** Supporting the growing market in Doha.
4.  **🇰🇼 Kuwait:** High demand for classic and sports cars.
5.  **🇧🇭 Bahrain:** Accessible market with frequent cross-border traffic.
6.  **🇴🇲 Oman:** Strong market for 4x4 and utility vehicles.

### Changing Your Location
By default, the site detects your IP. To see cars in another country:
1.  Click the **Flag Icon** in the top header.
2.  Select the desired country.
3.  The currency and listings will refresh to match that region.

## Important tips
*   **Physical Presence:** Most sellers require you to be physically present to inspect the car, even if you are buying for export.
*   **Customs Duties:** Buying a car from a different GCC country usually involves customs procedures at the border (typically 5% duty + VAT, though rules vary).
*   **Plate Transfers:** You generally cannot keep the license plate when exporting a car to another country; you will get "Export Plates".

## Common mistakes
*   **Ignoring Location:** Finding the perfect car but realizing later it is in Kuwait while you are in Dubai. Always check the "Location" field on the listing card.
*   **Assuming Free Transport:** The listed price never includes shipping or export fees unless clearly stated.
