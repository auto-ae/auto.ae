## Key concepts explained
| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Saved Search** | You subscribe to a specific filter (e.g., "Toyota Land Cruiser, 2024, Under 300k AED"). You get alerted when a *new* car matches this. |
| **Price Drop** | You "Heart" (Favorite) a specific listing. You get alerted if the seller *lowers* the price. |

## Types of Alerts

### 1. New Listing Alerts (Saved Search)
The most powerful tool for buyers. Instead of refreshing the page every day:
1.  Perform a search with your criteria.
2.  Click the **"Save Search"** button (Bell icon).
3.  Receive a push notification instantly when a matching car is listed.

### 2. Price Drop Alerts
Perfect for when a car is slightly over your budget.
1.  Tap the **Heart icon** on any car listing.
2.  If the seller reduces the price by any amount, you will know immediately.

### 3. Chat and Activity
*   **New Messages:** When a seller or buyer replies to your inquiry.
*   **Listing Status:** For sellers, alerts when your listing is approved or expires.

## How to Configure
You can manage your preferences to avoid spam.
1.  Go to **Profile** > **Settings**.
2.  Select **Notifications**.
3.  Toggle on/off specific channels (Email, Push, SMS).

## Common mistakes
*   **Saving Too Broad Searches:** If you save a search for just "BMW", you will get 100 alerts a day. Be specific: "BMW X5 2023".
*   **Ignoring Email:** Some official documents and receipts are sent only via email, not push.
