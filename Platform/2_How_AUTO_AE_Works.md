# Platform: How AUTO.AE Works

## Overview
Understanding the workflow of **AUTO.AE** is simple, whether you are here to buy, rent, or sell. The platform acts as a bridge, providing the tools to find the right vehicle or buyer, while the actual transaction details (payment methods, meeting times) are often arranged directly between the two parties. This guide outlines the general user journey on the platform.

### 1. Choose Your Category

### 2. Search and Filter
Use the detailed filters to narrow down thousands of options.
*   *For Cars:* Filter by Make, Model, Year, Price, Mileage, and Specs (GCC/Import).
*   *For Rentals:* Filter by Daily/Monthly price and Car Type (SUV, Sedan).

### 3. Review the Listing
Click on a vehicle to see the full details. Pay attention to:
*   High-quality photos (interior and exterior).
*   Description provided by the seller.
*   "Verified" badges on dealer accounts.

### 4. Contact the Seller
Once you find a match, use the contact buttons:
*   **Call:** Reveal the phone number to call immediately.
*   **WhatsApp:** Open a direct chat with the seller (most popular method).
*   **Chat:** Use the internal AUTO.AE chat system.

### 5. Inspect and Transact
Arrange a meeting to inspect the car.
*   **The Golden Rule:** Meet at a safe public place or an RTA Center.
*   **The Transfer:** Finalize the deal at an authorized center (Tasjeel, Shamil, or Barometer).
*   **Payment:** Hand over the cash/cheque only **after** the RTA officer confirms the transfer is ready to proceed.

### 6. Registration
To use the full features (like " Favorites" or "Listing a Car"), sign up using your **UAEMobile Number**. Verification is instant via OTP.



## Important tips
*   **No Registration Needed to Browse:** You can search and view phone numbers without creating an account.
*   **Register to Offer:** To list your own car or save favorites, you must register (it takes 1 minute via phone number).
*   **Safety First:** Never send money online without seeing the car. Read our [Safety Guide](75_Common_Sc) for more.
