## Office Location
While AUTO.AE is a digital-first platform, our headquarters are located in Dubai.
*   **Address:** Dubai Internet City, Building 12, Dubai, UAE.
*   **Working Hours:** Monday - Friday, 9:00 AM - 6:00 PM (GMT+4).

## Common mistakes
*   **Messaging Support for Car Details:** We are the platform, not the seller. Do not email support asking "Is this Camry still available?". Contact the seller directly via the listing.
*   **Sending Multiple Emails:** Please send one detailed email. Sending 5 emails slows down the response time.
