| **RTL (Right-to-Left)** | The layout direction for Arabic. The entire site layout mirrors when switched to Arabic. |

## Supported Languages

### 1. English (Default)
The business language of the UAE. Most expats and international buyers use the English interface.
*   *Menus:* Left-to-Right.
*   *Numbers:* Western Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3).

### 2. Arabic (العربية)
The official language of the GCC.
*   *Menus:* Right-to-Left.
*   *Numbers:* Eastern Arabic numerals (١, ٢, ٣) may be used in plate listings, though standard numerals are common.

### How to Switch Language
**On Website:**
1.  Look at the top right corner of the header.
2.  Click on **"Ar"** to switch to Arabic.
3.  Click on **"En"** to switch back to English.

**On Mobile App:**
1.  Go to **Profile** > **Settings**.
2.  Tap on **Language**.
3.  Select your preference. The app will restart to apply the new layout.

## Important tips
*   **Automatic Translation:** When you select features like "Bluetooth" or "Cruise Control" while creating a listing in English, an Arabic user will see the Arabic equivalent automatically. You do not need to translate these checkboxes.
*   **Description Field:** We recommend writing in English, as it is the "lingua franca" of the UAE car market.
*   **Legal Documents:** RTA Tests and Sales Agreements are generated in a bilingual (Arabic/English) format by default. You do not need to translate them.

## Common mistakes
*   **Writing Description in One Language Only:** If you write only in Arabic, you might miss 80% of expat buyers. English is safer if you choose only one.
*   **Ignoring Chat Language:** If a buyer messages you in English, try to reply in English.
*   **Legal Mismatch:** Remember, while the app is bilingual, the **RTA Sales Agreement** is legally binding in its Arabic text in court.
