# Platform: AUTO.AE Marketplace Overview

## Overview
**AUTO.AE** operates as a unified platform containing three distinct marketplaces: **Car Sales**, **Car Rentals**, and **VIP Plates**. While they share a single user account and interface, each marketplace has its own rules, search filters, and transaction styles. This page details the specific scope and functionality of each vertical to help you navigate the ecosystem effectively.

## The Three Marketplaces

### 1. The Sales Marketplace (Buy & Sell)
This is the heart of AUTO.AE, currently hosting **18,800+ live offers** (New & Used).
*   **Inventory:** From economical daily drivers to collector hypercars like the Rolls-Royce Cullinan.
*   **Price Range:** Options ranging from 10,000 AED up to **20,000,000 AED** for rare exclusives.
*   **Sellers:**
    *   *Private Sellers:* Individuals selling their personal cars.
    *   *Showrooms:* Registered dealers like "ALO CARS USED CARS" and "DEIZ GARAGE".
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **Price History:** See how the price of a listing has changed over time.
    *   **Trim Levels:** Advanced sorting by specific generation (e.g., Land Cruiser 300 Series).

### 2. The Rental Marketplace
Designed for temporary mobility needs, ranging from 1 day to 12 months.
*   **Inventory:** Economy cars, Luxury SUVs, Sports cars.
*   **Providers:** Only licensed rental agencies (no private individual rentals allowed for legal reasons).
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **Duration Filtering:** Toggle between "Daily" and "Monthly" rates.
    *   **Requirements:** Clear listing of deposit amounts and mileage limits.

### 3. The VIP Plates Marketplace
A niche, high-value marketplace for trading car license plates. This is unique to the GCC region where plates are status symbols.
*   **Inventory:** Dubai (RTA), Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, and other emirate plates.
*   **Categories:** 
    *   *Direct Sale:* Buy a plate at a fixed price.
    *   *Transferable:* Plates that are held by the owner and can be transferred at the traffic authority.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **Code Search:** Filter by specific plate codes (e.g., "A", "AA").
    *   **Digit Count:** Quickly find 2-digit, 3-digit, or 4-digit plates.

## Important tips
*   **Global Login:** Your single user account works for all three marketplaces. You can sell a car and buy a plate with the same profile.
*   **Separate Chats:** Messages are organized by listing, so you won't confuse a rental inquiry with a purchase negotiation.
*   **Currency:** All prices are primarily displayed in AED (UAE Dirhams), though conversion is available.

## Common mistakes
*   **Confusing Rent/Buy:** Always check the tab. A price of "3000 AED" might be a monthly rental payment, not a car's purchase price!
*   **Ignoring Plate City:** A Dubai plate cannot be registered on an Abu Dhabi car without specific transfer procedures. Always check the Emirate.
