# Platform: Currencies and Price Display

## Overview
Because **AUTO.AE** serves a multi-national region, understanding how prices are displayed and converted is crucial. The base currency for the majority of listings is the **United Arab Emirates Dirham (AED)**, but the platform provides tools to view prices in your local currency for convenience.

## Key concepts explained
| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **AED** | United Arab Emirates Dirham. The standard currency for typical listings. |
| **Pegged Currency** | Most GCC currencies (AED, SAR, QAR) are pegged to the US Dollar, meaning exchange rates are very stable. |
| **VAT** | Value Added Tax (usually 5% in UAE). |

## Supported Currencies

By default, the currency matches the country you are browsing.
*   **UAE:** AED
*   **Saudi Arabia:** SAR
*   **Qatar:** QAR
*   **Kuwait:** KWD
*   **Bahrain:** BHD
*   **Oman:** OMR
*   **USA/International:** USD

### How Conversion Works
If you are viewing a car located in Dubai (priced in AED) but you have selected "Saudi Arabia" as your region, the platform will show an **approximate** conversion in SAR.
> **Note:** The actual transaction will likely take place in the seller's local currency (AED).

### VAT Display
*   **Dealers/Showrooms:** Prices usually **include** VAT unless stated otherwise, but you must confirm.
*   **Private Sellers:** There is no VAT on private car sales between individuals in the UAE.

## Important tips
*   **Negotiate in Local Currency:** If the seller is in Dubai, negotiate in AED. Trying to fix a price in USD might lead to confusion due to bank exchange rates.
*   **Hidden Costs:** The listed price is for the car itself. Registration, insurance, and export tests are extra.

## Common mistakes
*   **Assuming Exchange Rates are Fixed:** While GCC currencies are stable, bank transfer fees can affect the final amount you pay.
*   **Forgetting VAT:** If buying from a showroom for export, you might be able to claim VAT back, but sticking to the listed price calculation is safer for budgeting.
